			<a href="http://5star-casinos.com/aruba-after-dark" title="Aruba &#8211; After Dark"></a><p><strong>Aruba &#8211; After Dark</strong></p>
<p>Though the Caribbean is known for its laidback attitude, the party never seems to stop in Aruba. Many of Aruba&#8217;s fine resorts feature live entertainment and casinos, while local dance clubs are full of partygoers throughout the night. In Oranjestad &#8211; Aruba&#8217;s bustling capital &#8211; bars don&#8217;t start filling up until 10 or 11 pm and remain open until 2 am. Meanwhile, Aruba&#8217;s dance clubs generally peak around 2 am and dancing can go until the early morning. Combine this with a live stage show, a tour bus that runs through the night and a 24-hour casino and you have the perfect way to spend an exciting night in Aruba. </p>
<p>&#13;Aruba boasts 11 casinos, all of which accept U.S. currency in the slot machines and at the tables. Since the first casino opened in 1959, each casino that has sprouted up along the beach has been outfitted with the casual elegance you expect of the Caribbean. Most of the casinos open in stages throughout the day, with slot machines generally accessible at 10 am and card tables taking bets later in the afternoon. For those who would rather press their luck than sleep, the elegant Crystal Casino at the Renaissance Aruba Resort remains open 24/7. Whatever casino you choose to visit, try your hand at Caribbean Stud Poker &#8211; the now famous game invented in Aruba in 1988. </p>
<p>&#13;If want to experience what the bar and nightclub scene has to offer, hitch a ride on one of Aruba&#8217;s many party buses. These tours &#8211; most of which are conducted in converted 1957 Chevy buses &#8211; visit several of the island&#8217;s hotspots each night. Though each tour offers different perks, most the party bus packages include dinner at the start of the evening and the first drink at three separate nightclubs. If you choose to visit any of Aruba&#8217;s bars or nightclubs on your own, taxis are easy to find and are in service throughout the night. </p>
<p>&#13;However, not all visitors have partying on their minds. For travelers that enjoy going out but want to avoid the noisy revelers, Aruba also has plenty of relaxing spots to sip cocktails and enjoy downbeat entertainment. The Caribbean brand of relaxed entertainment usually begins on the beach during the early evening happy hour. From there, most visitors retreat to one of Aruba&#8217;s world-class restaurants for a candlelit dinner or board one the island&#8217;s luxurious dinner cruises. </p>
<p>&#13;Regardless of how you choose to experience the dining and nightlife of Aruba, all visitors can enjoy the famous stage shows at local resorts and casinos. The best ticket in Aruba is Let&#8217;s Go Latin! &#8211; the largest stage production in the Caribbean. Featuring 26 performers from Cuba&#8217;s world-renowned dance studios and over 180 distinctive costumes, this dazzling show has enchanted guests of all ages. With a combination of up-tempo Latin attitude and Broadway production quality, this sharp modern production won&#8217;t be going out of style any time soon. As the show is extremely popular, reserve your tickets at least a few days in advance. For the best value and a taste of some of Aruba&#8217;s best cuisine, purchase a dinner and performance package that includes a three-course meal at the celebrated L&#8217;Escale. </p>
<p>&#13;When you arrive in Aruba, try to check out local publications and special offer brochures available at your hotel. Local magazines such as Aruba Nights, K-Pasa and Aruba Experience highlight all the events on the island each week. These publications, as well as local English-language newspapers should be available at your resort free of charge. Lastly, if you intend to spend a night or two on the town, ask your concierge about possible discounts for food, drinks and transportation.</p>

			<a href="http://5star-casinos.com/the-different-games-of-poker" title="The Different Games of Poker"></a><p><strong>The Different Games of Poker</strong></p>
<p>The game of poker is slowly gaining a lot of popularity among the game savvy people. There are many types of poker games that have originated with time. Among them the popular and well-known ones are</p>
<p>Texas holdem: This is the most famous type of poker game and is played by people from all the corners of the globe. The rules are simple and this game can be played by ten as well as two players. Four betting sessions complete a round. The game starts with a player receiving two cards put face down and there are also five face up community cards kept for the use of the players. The winner of the pot is the player with the highest five-card poker hand.</p>
<p>Omaha Hi: Very similar to Texas holdem, this form of poker is also gaining fame with the passage of time. The betting rounds are four and each player gets four face down hole cards to deal with. To win, one must combine exactly two of their hole cards with the three available community cards and bring forth a five-card poker hand.</p>
<p>Seven card stud: This poker game can be played between two to eight players. An ante begins the game followed by the five sessions of bets. Three cards can be kept face down by the player but four must be showed to the opponents. The aim of the game is to make a five card poker hand by the available seven cards.</p>
<p>Five card draw: Reputed as one of the oldest form of poker, this game can be played by two to five players. Two betting rounds follow the ante. Five face down cards are given to the players which they may draw up or give up after the first round of betting gets over. Here also, the winner of the pot is the one with the highest five card hand holder.Â </p>
<p>Caribbean Stud poker: This is a complete new version of poker. Unlike the other types here the players play against the house which plays the role of a bank dealer. To win the game of Caribbean stud a player must beat the bank dealer&#8217;s hand of cards. The players of the game are not competitors.</p>
<p>To be a successful poker player one must know the rules as well as the type of game they are playing. Unless you are informed about the game and its types, you cannot score well and as a result lose chances of winning the game.Â </p>
