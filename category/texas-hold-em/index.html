			<a href="http://5star-casinos.com/texas-hold-em-tournament-strategy-avoid-coin-flip-hands" title="Texas Hold Em Tournament Strategy &#8211; Avoid Coin-Flip Hands"></a><p><strong>Texas Hold Em Tournament Strategy &#8211; Avoid Coin-Flip Hands</strong></p>
<p>A good Texas Hold Em Tournament Strategy will stress the important of avoiding coin-flip hands but this point is even more important early on in the tournament. Later in the game, at the money tables or last table sometimes you are required to take the punt but a lot of players generally have difficulty getting this far in the tournament. Avoiding coin-flip hands early on can be a critical factor in ensuring you stay alive long enough to take home some cash.</p>
<p>Early in the tournament, don&#8217;t play coin-flip hands for all your money. Incase you don&#8217;t know, a coin-flip hand is a hand where the odds depict you and your partner both have a fairly even chance of winning. So its about 50-50, the odds of flipping a coin and guessing heads or tails. A classic example of this is when one play has two overcards, like K-Q and the other player has an under paid, like J-J. So with these hands both players have essentially about the same chance to win. In this example if you had the pair of jacks you are favoured to win but its not by much. I definitely wouldn&#8217;t want my future in the tournament falling in the hands of odds like this. The major issue with situations like this, in tournaments, is that if you lose you&#8217;ve lost. You&#8217;re out of the tournament and you can&#8217;t get back in. This is the biggest thing you want to avoid.</p>
<p>If you win a coin-flip hand then you get to double up &#8211; that is you get all the other persons chips and double your stack in one hand. This is a great benefit to your underlying Texas Hold Em Tournament Strategy because having more chips means you have more power and a better chance of winning. However, the effect of losing the coin-flip hand, again, you losing and being out of the tournament, is a risk that I would not want to be taking, no matter how juicy the reward.  The thing is, doubling up early on in a tournament doesn&#8217;t really mean that much, there is still a long long way to go before your at the end. Doubling up later in the tournament is hugely advantageous.</p>
<p>So, if whatever Texas Hold Em Tournament Strategy you have is ever going to work, you need to actually be in the tournament to implement it. Playing coin-flip hands could jeopardise you existence in the tournaments and this is why I refrain from playing them early on. Although the benefits of winning one can be doubling up your chips this still isn&#8217;t worth the risk in my books. The next time your in a poker tournament think twice before you go through with a coin-flip hand. You just might find that the coin doesn&#8217;t land on your side.</p>

			<a href="http://5star-casinos.com/texas-hold-em-tournament-strategy-make-a-move" title="Texas Hold Em Tournament Strategy &#8211; Make A Move"></a><p><strong>Texas Hold Em Tournament Strategy &#8211; Make A Move</strong></p>
<p>Whatever your Texas Hold Em Tournament Strategy is it has to incorporate something to allow you to be free enough to make a move. At some point in the tournament, when you have enough chips to make your opponent think twice about calling you, you need to make a move on the pot. This could be when you have a good hand or even if you don&#8217;t. Often you have to make your move sooner rather then later and waiting for the perfect hand will just take too long.</p>
<p>The last thing you want to do is let you stack dwindle down to almost nothing so that the other players will just call you because they have so many chips. If your stack sizes are so unbalanced you may have a situation on your hands. When it gets to the point that your opponent will just call you automatically no matter what they have then you are in trouble. You need to understand that when you are severely short stacked you just can&#8217;t make a big enough dint in their stack even if you win the pot.</p>
<p>Sometimes players get so afraid of being losing their chips and being kicked out of the tournament that they don&#8217;t make a move soon enough. They are constantly playing defensive and let their stacks slowly but surely get taken away. Before they know it, even when they do hit that great hand they just don&#8217;t have enough chips to do anything with it. Don&#8217;t allow your fear to take over you and let this happen. You need to maintain yourself in a competitive position.</p>
<p>If your stack is down to only four of five times the big blind you need to move in immediately. Anything less is practically useless. It doesn&#8217;t matter what kind of hand you have you have to do it. Your only other option is to slowly die. You need to move in when you still have enough power to strike at least a little fear in your opponent.</p>
<p>Any good Texas Hold Em Tournament Strategy will hammer the fact that staying alive in a tournament is your number one goal. Of course this is true. However, sometimes you need to make a move with your chips and risk this just to be able to have a chance of winning. I&#8217;m sure you would prefer a Texas Hold Em Tournament Strategy that aims for taking the top prize then one that just favours staying alive and puttering in at a lower position. </p>

			<a href="http://5star-casinos.com/texas-hold-em-tournament-strategy-powerful-chips" title="Texas Hold Em Tournament Strategy &#8211; Powerful Chips"></a><p><strong>Texas Hold Em Tournament Strategy &#8211; Powerful Chips</strong></p>
<p>Getting chips, growing you stack, becoming more powerful is the most important part of any good Texas Hold Em Poker Strategy. Chips are power, that is that. When you have more chips you have more options. Growing you stack and getting more chips will put your in a good position to win a tournament, or at least get to a money table. If however your chips dwindle and your stack gets smaller and smaller your odds of winning decrease.</p>
<p>In Texas Hold Em Tournament poker, the players with big stacks will prey on the players with little stacks. The more powerful someone is because they have so many chips the more they will abuse this power and push everyone else around. In poker this is called &#8216;bullying&#8217; and it is completely within the rules.</p>
<p>The rich get richer and the poor get poorer. This is because the players with lots of chips will continually attack and  consume the players with the smaller stacks. Its a never ending circle of demise because the players with smaller stacks get afraid to fight the big bullies plus when they do fight they don&#8217;t really have that much impact. When you have lots of chips your options expand &#8211; suddenly you can afford to take a chance on that all-in because even if you lose your not out of the tournament.</p>
<p>In tournament poker the blinds and antes will increase at period intervals. It could be 20, 30 or 60 mins depending on the tournament, but the whole point is that they are only going up. If your not at least increasing your stack in line with this then you are going backwards. Indeed staying still is going backwards. You need to be winning at least one hand per round or else your stack will shrink and you won&#8217;t be able to keep up with the blinds.</p>
<p>Players who are so tight that they only ever play pocket aces or pocket kings, however well they do in cash games, will not survive in tournament poker. They might get to later in the tournament just by not losing but they won&#8217;t increase their stack enough to keep up with the blinds and their demise will be inevitable. Being short stacked later in the tournament is pretty much a ticket to losing.</p>
<p>Chips are indeed the most powerful part of poker tournament. Your Texas Hold Em Tournament Strategy needs to be one that successfully grows your stack &#8211; in line with the blind increases at a minimum &#8211; or else it will be doomed for failure. Growing you stack, playing more hands, bullying and calling all-ins at the right time are all fundamental to having the most chips, the most power and the biggest chance of winning the tournament.</p>

			<a href="http://5star-casinos.com/texas-hold-em-tips-and-tricks" title="Texas Hold Em Tips and Tricks"></a><p><strong>Texas Hold Em Tips and Tricks</strong></p>
<p>There are many texas hold em tips and tricks but none more important than this â do not ever attempt to bluff a new player. There are thousands of books written on how to play texas hold em, many of which tell you to play the odds against the new players. My honest opinion is avoid them as much as possible. Play with the new players who play tight, you can figure out what theyâre going to do quite easily, but avoid the new players who call every hand and will call on the river with a pair of twos. Well, donât entirely avoid them, but donât land yourself in a coin flip situation with them either. Wait until you pick up something they canât beat then take all their chips.</p>
<p>As for beginning tight players, intermediate players and advanced players just donât outthink yourself. If you think you have the winning hand, you probably do. If youâre playing with a group of intermediate players and you see a possible straight or flush on the board and there are more than two people in the hand betting, itâs safe to assume someone has the straight or the flush and you should fold immediately. The intermediate and beginners will play for straights or flushes more often than a great player. The great players know odds, outs, and what not so if youâre playing a numbers game youâre much safer against the good players than the bad.</p>
<p>Then again the good players will bluff you out of certain hands you could win, butÂ  if you think itâs a lost hand, well you already lost the hand. If you feel you have the hand won, then call or bet. Pick your spots to bluff, and know your opponents. You can study their habits, hand selection, etc while youâre not in the hand. Keep track of what theyâre winning with. People have patterns about them. Professionals are professionals because they are good at switching up how they play depending on the situation and the opponent but they still have an underlying style to which they play. If youâre playing tight, they may switch to a more aggressive style to take advantage. Pick a spot to move in. Wait for your chances. This isnât a game where you have to play every pot or win every battle. Itâs a war. Take down the pots you can and throw away the ones you canât. Itâs that basic. You donât have to bluff everyone every five hands to pick up chips. Pick your spots. Think football or hockey. When youâre on offense you want to win the pot. When youâre on defense you want to prevent your opponent from taking your chips. Itâs basically that simple. Fold when you canât win as youâre preventing your opponents from taking any more of your chips and bet when you have a good hand. You may not win every pot youâre betting, just like in football you donât score a touchdown every time, but youâre going in with the intention of taking down the hand.</p>
<p>There are millions of texas hold em tips and tricks that can be given out. The most important one is protect your chips. Take from your opponents without letting them take from you. Donât make bad calls and youâll be fine.</p>

<p>Texas Hold Em Poker takes a few minutes to learn but a lifetime to master. I&#8217;m going to go a tad further then the rules and explain the mechanics of the game.</p>
<p>The game begins when the deal deals two cards face down to each player at the table. These are called down cards or hole cards or pocket cards. No one else can see your cards and you don&#8217;t know anyone else&#8217;s cards on the table. The cards are delivered in a clockwise fashion around the table. There is a button, which is like a little disc, which is the dealer button. The cards are dealt starting at the first person left of the button. Each hand the button moves one player around, rotating slowly.</p>
<p>The first person to the left of the button, the one that gets the cards dealt to them first, is the small blind. The next player left of him is called the big blind. Both of these players must put a mandatory amount of chips in to the pot to play. Because they are forced to bet before the get cards they are &#8216;betting blind&#8217;. The blinds stimulate action by growing the pot the players will compete for. The big blind puts in a &#8216;full&#8217; bet (whatever the minimum bet is set at) and the small blind is always half of that. Eg, the BB is 0 and the SB is 0.</p>
<p>Each player can do one of three things when its their turn. They can call, which is posting the amount of the big blind to play, they can raise, which is posting the amount of the big blind plus extra, or they can fold, which is throw away their cards and not play that hand anymore. If you want to raise you must bet an amount that is at least twice the size of the last raise. So if you are the first to raise it must be twice the size of the big blind. If someone raises in front of you and you want to raise him, you must at least double the amount of chips your opponent has bet. Remember in No Limit Texas Hold Em Poker there is no limit to the maximum amount you can bet. At any time you or your opponent can go all-in. All in is raising with all of your chips and is proves to be a very strong play. There&#8217;s a famous saying that goes something like &#8216;Players that go all in will win every time bar once&#8217;. Be careful because once your out of chips your out of the game.</p>
<p>After everyone has made their play, called, raised or folded, all the bets go into the middle pot and the dealer will deal the flop. The dealer will burn the first face down card of the deck which means he throws it away not to be used (its always face down so no one gets to see it). He then will turn over three cards and put them in the middle. This is the flop. These cards are the community cards and everyone gets to use them. Now, another round of betting occurs. After the flop a player has the opportunity to check if no one has bet anything in front of him. Checking is essentially not betting and not folding. You get to stay in without betting. The other choices a player has is to bet or to fold. If you bet, again, you must bet a minimum of the big blind. So after all the players have made their move, some betting and possibly other players betting more etc the dealer will pile all the chips into the pot again.</p>
<p>The dealer then deals one more face up card, called the turn. The turn is another community card so everyone gets to use it. Now the players have six cards (their two hole cards and the four on the board) to make their best five card hand. Another round of betting happens, again where players can check, bet, call or bet more, or fold. After the conclusion of that betting round the dealer will pile all the chips into the pot and deal one more face up card. The last community card is the river. The After the river there are the five community cards for everyone to use and each player has their own two hole cards. Here each player knows their best hand and there isn&#8217;t any wiggle room. A final round of betting will occur. Here players can check, bet, call or bet or fold, just like in the others.</p>
<p>After the final round of betting after the river, all the chips are piled up into the middle and there is a showdown. You and your opponents show your hole cards face up in front of you. The player who initiated the final betting round is obligated to show his or hand first. If everyone check then the player to the left of the dealer shows his cards first. The dealer then pushes the pot to the best five-card combination. Its that simple.</p>
<p>I hope you have been able to learn Texas Hold Em Poker from the brief explanation I have provided. These points are the crux of how the game is played. I have not gone into detail about the different hands, like what a pair, full house or flush is. You will need to learn these though if you are ever going to win Texas Hold Em Poker. You need to know which cards beat what if you are ever going to win. I hope you enjoyed this article and have heaps of fun playing this fabulous card game!</p>

			<a href="http://5star-casinos.com/texas-hold-em-tournament-strategy-blind-defenders" title="Texas Hold Em Tournament Strategy &#8211; Blind Defenders"></a><p><strong>Texas Hold Em Tournament Strategy &#8211; Blind Defenders</strong></p>
<p>One of the many facets to a good Texas Hold Em Tournament Strategy is being able to correctly identify other players types and play style. This can go far beyond the simple tight/loose passive/aggressive stereotypes. There are many nuances to how any player can play. A very interesting one, and one you need to pay attention to especially in Texas Hold Em tournaments are the blind defenders.</p>
<p>Defenders of the blind, as they are commonly called, are players who just hate to give up their blinds. When they are in the position of posting the small or big blind they will play with whatever cards they have, no matter how bad. If there is a blind defender at your table, when he is in the big blind you just know that if you raise the pot he will call you just because he is on the blind. Even worse, blind defenders may even come over the top of you. If you have a loose player like this you may need to think twice about raising or playing a hand when they are in the blind.</p>
<p>Defenders of the blind love to send a message to everyone at the table that they will not be taken advantage of. A good Texas Hold Em Tournament Strategy is to steal peoples blinds to grow your stack. You might be able to steal a blind once, but after that a blind defender will just come over the top of you no matter what they have. They take the risk of losing just to send the message that they won&#8217;t be taken advantage of and no one can steal their blinds.</p>
<p>The opposite player to the blind defender is a player that is so tight they don&#8217;t want to risk the chips on bad cards. Even if this player is in the blind if they don&#8217;t have a good hand they won&#8217;t play. They don&#8217;t get attached to their blind or feel the need to fight for it or protect it. They don&#8217;t want to take the risk. With this sort of player you can be confident that if you raise they probably won&#8217;t raise you back. If you are sitting in late position and no one has raised in front of you, and this type of player is in the blind, you should raise no matter what you have. You may be able to steal the blind. Most of the time he won&#8217;t raise you, he&#8217;ll fold, and you can steal his blind.</p>
<p>Being able to identify blind defenders, and also those people that aren&#8217;t, is a critical Texas Hold Em Tournament Strategy because the ability to steal blinds whenever you can is a crucial part of building your stack. The bigger your stack is the better chance you have winning the tournament. Watch players, assess them and put them on a type, and then alter how you play in order to best exploit them.</p>

<p>Bottom line a player wants to bet because he wants to play!</p>
<p>Basic &#8211; usually a sign that they are keen to bet because they have a good hand.<br />Advanced Texas Hold Em &#8211; advanced players will purposely do this tell when they have a weak hand.<br />Super Advanced &#8211; will do this four or five times when they have a weak hand and then when they have a very strong hand will pretend to do it, making you think they have a weak hand, so you bet all-in and lose.</p>
<p>Players looking at your stack:</p>
<p>Opponents that do this are literally &#8216;seeing&#8217; your chips as theirs</p>
<p>Basic &#8211; usually a sign the player has a good hand are think they will win against you<br />Advanced Texas Hold Em &#8211; I find advanced players too look at stacks when they think they will win. But they might be looking at a different players smaller stack because they think they can beat that specific person<br />Super Advanced &#8211; will be looking everywhere and anywhere. I wouldn&#8217;t rely on this one here. Watch for being setup as well.</p>
<p>Players looking at their own stack:</p>
<p>When the cards drop on the flop, turn or river, a player that glances down at their own stack for a split second because they want their cards in the pot!</p>
<p>Basic &#8211; they have a good hand and want to play<br />Advanced Texas Hold Em &#8211; they have a hand they think they can win with and want to play<br />Super Advanced &#8211; Their thinking about how well they are going to obliterate you. Or they won&#8217;t even do the glance at all.</p>
