			<a href="http://5star-casinos.com/how-to-play-sit-and-go-poker" title="How to play sit and Go Poker"></a><p><strong>How to play sit and Go Poker</strong></p>
<p>Single Table Tournaments, STTs, Sit and go, Sit n go, SNGs and all other nicknames refer to the same thing, a type of Texas hold em poker where the player ‘buys in&#8217; to the tournament for a set fee, receives the equal amounts of chips and then battles to be the last one standing. </p>
<p>Sit and Go poker tournaments are extremely convenient for the poker players at beginner&#8217;s level as they have a set fee only unlike cash tables with no limits. Also this type of Poker is quick to play.</p>
<p>If you are a beginner it is always better to start from lowest stakes table and gradually build up the budget once you are comfortable with the game.  Also, as these Single Table Tournaments are ‘freeze-out tournaments&#8217;, so these are the best for beginner level players. The term ‘freeze-out&#8217; means that the player cannot re-buy into the game if he loses his chips. So the worst that can happen is that a poker beginner can only lose his buy-in fee.</p>
<p>The following section gives you few Sit and Go tips to poker beginners and will help you to learn sit n go poker.</p>
<p>As a beginner you should always play to your level and should not enter expensive tournaments where the skill level of other players will be high. The other reason to avoid these tournaments is that it will affect your confidence and can drain any enjoyment out of the game.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t engage yourself in making silly bets. In the beginning you should always fold any poor hands and play tight.  At this stage it is extremely important to act in position and use control to your advantage, as well as preserving your all important chips.</p>
<p>As the game progresses and few players are knocked down it is a time for you to loosen up and start bluffing and play weaker hands. The key at this point is survival. So keep on taking as many pots as possible to ensure you can keep paying for your blinds and stay in the tournament.  Most of the profit in a sit n go tournament will come from opponents making mistakes at the bubble. Bubble can be defined as the point where there is just one opponent to go before the paying places begin. </p>
<p>And if you are lucky to get to the last two or three players, then that&#8217;s the time to get really aggressive. Use the chips you have to lead the betting and start reading the opposition rather than simply relying on the cards you have in your hand.</p>
<p>And remember, that you won&#8217;t be able to win every Sit and Go tournament, but as long as you stick to the games with low buy ins, you can pick yourself up and give it another go without wasting your precious money.</p>
<p>There is always some aspect of the poker player&#8217;s game that can be improved. So at the end of play, always look back at the hands you played well and the ones which could have been played better. The more you practice the better the chance of you winning more. So look for the best poker school online and start honing your poker skills and improve your poker play.</p>

			<a href="http://5star-casinos.com/poker-tournament-tips-my-top-5-poker-tournament-tips" title="Poker Tournament Tips &#8211; My Top 5 Poker Tournament Tips"></a><p><strong>Poker Tournament Tips &#8211; My Top 5 Poker Tournament Tips</strong></p>
<p><strong>My Top 5 Poker Tournament Tips</strong></p>
<p>The following is a list of My Top 5 Poker Tournament Tips. Previously, I had difficulties playing poker tournaments. I would either be out of the tournament extremely early, make it for a while but get crushed, or get pretty far but never actually make it to the money tables. Once I learnt a bunch of poker tournament tips things got easier. So I decided to share the tops ones with avid poker players like you.</p>
<p>The thing is, if you&#8217;re currently not experiencing the success in poker that you would like, it isn&#8217;t your fault. The reason you are losing likely has nothing to do with you, its just the information you have been provided wasn&#8217;t good enough. This isn&#8217;t surprising seeing the sheer amount of bogus information available on the Internet these days. The great thing is, winning poker tournaments doesn&#8217;t require hundreds of hours of practice time, complex strategies or memorizing charts and tables. You just have to follow some good guidelines like those outlined below.</p>
<p><strong>Top 5 Poker Tournament Tips</strong></p>
<p>#1 Aim For First Place</p>
<p>The single most important tip I can give you for success at a poker tournament is to aim for first place. Enter and play in the tournament with the plan, no, with the expectation that you are going to leave there winning first place. Don&#8217;t let anything stand in your way and definitely do not settle for second best. Some of the most destructive things you can do to yourself is think &#8216;If I can just get to a money table&#8217; or &#8216;I&#8217;ll be happy if I get in the top 5&#8242;.</p>
<p>#2 Be Careful What Cards You Play</p>
<p>You need to be extra careful what cards you do actually play in the tournament. For the most part, if you lose all your chips in a poker tournament you cannot buy back into the tournament. You are out, that&#8217;s it. It&#8217;s this fear that really strikes a lot of people because they are scared to lose. You just need to be a little more careful with what cards you do play. This gets less important at the final tables but for the start you want to be a little tight. And avoid coin-flip hands like the plague.</p>
<p>#3 Pay Attention To Everything</p>
<p>It&#8217;s imperative you pay tonnes of attention to the game at hand from the start of the tournament right through to the end. Lazy players and those that get bored concentrating so much are not the types of players that take the first place cash prize. You&#8217;re watching to notice players styles, characters, the moves they make, how they respond to actions like being raised when they are in the blind as opposed to not etc. etc. This information will be crucial later on when you are up against them at a different table.</p>
<p>#4 Steal Blinds Whenever You Can</p>
<p>Stealing blinds is the forefront way to get in a great position to win the tournament. If you concentrate on just doing this single act alone you will have 100 times the chance of winning compared to someone who isn&#8217;t. Picking up blinds whenever you can, and ruthlessly stealing them from weak players is important to building your stack. And you&#8217;re going to need a big stack if you expect to win at the final table.</p>
<p>#5 Don&#8217;t Give Up, Ever</p>
<p>Its no doubt you&#8217;ll have ups and downs in poker tournaments. You win some and you lose some. You will take bad beats, you will get unlucky and you will definitely be faced with a small stack sooner or later. The most important thing you can do is to never give up. If you stop playing tournaments all together you won&#8217;t build up the experience to be able to win them. Remember, it is possible to come back from having a small stack to win a tournament!</p>

			<a href="http://5star-casinos.com/advanced-poker-strategy-5-top-tips-for-advanced-poker-play" title="Advanced Poker Strategy &#8211; 5 Top Tips For Advanced Poker Play"></a><p><strong>Advanced Poker Strategy &#8211; 5 Top Tips For Advanced Poker Play</strong></p>
<p>Need some new ideas to really push your advanced poker strategy into overdrive? Don&#8217;t miss out on these top tips revealing a few secrets to success.</p>
<p>Advanced Poker Strategy Tip #1 &#8211; Always, and I mean always, capitalise on position.</p>
<p>Most of your money is made when you are in those last few seats at the cutoff. This is where you can shine and all of the odds are stacked in your favour. You need to make sure you are actually making money in these positions because you can do so so much easier than when you are in a blind or up early. Don&#8217;t miss out on the opportunity that comes by only once in every 7 or 8 hands.</p>
<p>Advanced Poker Strategy Tip #2 &#8211; Have your strategy and stick to it.</p>
<p>The biggest crime to commit playing Hold Em Poker is to just sit down and play. Sure this is fine if you are just playing recreationally on a very small table but if you are playing seriously to make money (and have fun doing it of course) you need to have a well thought out strategy and, more importantly, you need to stick to it. What&#8217;s more fun than making money anyways?</p>
<p>Advanced Poker Strategy Tip #3 &#8211; Sit down with the table limit.</p>
<p>If you can&#8217;t sit down at the table with the biggest stack possible you shouldn&#8217;t be at that table. If the table limit is half of what you&#8217;ve got in your kitty then go to smaller stakes games. You need to have enough money that you can use it and work with it and you aren&#8217;t stressed or worried about losing it.</p>
<p>Advanced Poker Strategy Tip #4 &#8211; Have enough bankroll to support yourself.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s critical that you have a big enough bankroll to support your ups and downs over the long term. You don&#8217;t want to be on a downwards streak and not be able to continue to wait for the odds to turn back just because your out of cash. Always have 20 or more times the table limit in your bankroll and you&#8217;ll be fine.</p>
<p>Advanced Poker Strategy Tip #5 &#8211; Realise advanced play isn&#8217;t fancy-schmancy terms</p>
<p>Being able to explain the mathematical reasoning behind game theory, or discuss the merits and drawbacks of the Independent Chip Model might make you sound cool, and might even help out a little with your poker game, but it doesn&#8217;t make you a good player. Real advanced poker strategy is made up of timeless classic rules. Learn them, practice them, follow them, and the money will just come.</p>

			<a href="http://5star-casinos.com/texas-poker-strategy-the-crucial-components-you-need-to-win" title="Texas Poker Strategy &#8211; The Crucial Components You Need To Win"></a><p><strong>Texas Poker Strategy &#8211; The Crucial Components You Need To Win</strong></p>
<p>Texas Poker Strategy Crucial Component #1 &#8211; Betting Strategy</p>
<p>A betting strategy would have to be the first and foremost thing you need for a successful Texas Poker strategy. Without a betting strategy you may as well just be randomly doing anything.</p>
<p>The mistake most people make is they think they have to make the decision on what to bet then and there, when they are in the game. This can&#8217;t be more further from the truth. You can completely plan out your whole strategy before you even sit down at the table. I&#8217;m sure you are realizing now that if you took the time to plan what you will do if you have X cards and an opponent bets Y, you will surely be ahead in the game.</p>
<p>Texas Poker Strategy Crucial Component #2 &#8211; Position And Card Strategy</p>
<p>This is probably the most important but I had to put it second. Pretty much just like betting without this you don&#8217;t even have a game. They go hand in hand to formulating your Texas Poker strategy they should practically go together.</p>
<p>Your position and card strategy is everything. You should know which cards you will play in which positions and why. Then, you should know which cards you will play after the flop depending on what is on the flop, and you should know your preference for continuing or folding all the way down to the river depending on what cards are showing (also called risk cards or scare cards etc.)</p>
<p>Texas Poker Strategy Crucial Component #3 &#8211; Psychological Strategy</p>
<p>This is pretty hefty and makes up the remainder of your game, but isn&#8217;t 100% required. If you are lacking this area in your Texas Poker strategy don&#8217;t worry because you are not the first. But any successful poker player has a strategy for this.</p>
<p>Your psychological strategy will involve many different things. Firstly, the image your want to present. The style you want to present. The type of player you want to pretend to be or act like. This can also involve semi-bluffing, bluffing, bullying/scare tactics, reading tells, giving off voluntary tells etc.</p>
<p>There is one more thing though, that if you figure it out you will halve the amount of time and save over 90% of your costs of acquiring your own successful Texas Poker strategy, but it&#8217;s only for the people who are intensely dedicated to becoming a successful poker player. No tire-kicking, lazy excuse makers will ever get their hands on it because there is a small test to find it.</p>

<p>If there is one type of person in the world who watches alot of poker it is definitely poker dealers. They&#8217;ve seen it all. When players take in huge wins tips go to the dealer, when they lose the dealer sees their despair. Because poker dealers are involved with poker so much they usually know a thing or two about poker. Today I&#8217;m going to share some poker dealers tips I got from a poker dealer when I was having a chat with him.</p>
<p>Poker Dealers Tips &#8211; Relax Your Face</p>
<p>This one is probably the most overlooked tip when playing poker. I mean, come on, the poker face cliche is known for a reason. Cliche&#8217;s aren&#8217;t just made up they are based on truth, they happen so often that&#8217;s how they become a cliche. Most new players forget this. The thing is, holding a poker face is more important then ever in todays day and age. With the new advent of systems like FACS and F.A.C.E (just google it if you don&#8217;t know what it is) means that savvy players can detect even the smallest facial expression changes in anyone. This means they have one more piece of info to figure out what you have and beat you. Many people who haven&#8217;t trained themselves will perform micro-emotion facial expressions almost unconsciously. This is a dead giveaway to what you have. This poker dealer couldn&#8217;t believe how often even he could tell if a player had a good hand or a bad one just by watching their face, nothing else.</p>
<p>I really liked this poker dealers tips. There is only one way to be successful at Texas Hold em Poker and that is to constantly win more pots with better play. Try these tips the next time your sitting at the No Limit Hold Em Poker table.</p>

			<a href="http://5star-casinos.com/texas-hold-em-poker-tip-make-correct-decisions" title="Texas Hold Em Poker Tip &#8211; Make Correct Decisions"></a><p><strong>Texas Hold Em Poker Tip &#8211; Make Correct Decisions</strong></p>
<p>This Texas Hold Em Poker tip can be boiled right down to this. What is the objective of poker? What is YOUR objective when playing poker? Is it to make money? Is it to win the most pots? Well, if winning the most money and pots was your objective then you should play every single pot, raise big at every go. You would most likely win the most pots but that&#8217;s not beating the game. What about enjoying yourself? Is that the objective of poker. Yes, for some people, but that&#8217;s not beating the game, that&#8217;s enjoying the game. You can do both.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, poker is all about making the correct decisions. Understanding that making correct decisions is  the critical point this Texas Hold Em Poker tip is trying to convey. Take just that home and you&#8217;ve done well for today. If you make all the correct decisions you will succeed. You you make poor decisions you will likely fail very quickly. </p>
<p>Playing poker is kind of like investing. You get your money, gather and learn as much information as possible, make a decisions on investing you money and hope you get a good return. If you do or you don&#8217;t, that goes back into the information pool, you change or alter you decision and invest again, trying to get a good return. This is investing. Funnily enough this is exactly what poker is. You get your money, in the form of chips. Gather information on the other  players and the cards you have (odds etc.), make a decision when to investing and how much and hope for a good return. Depending on what happens alters how you will do it next time, and the cycle goes on. The thing is, in poker, you get results within minutes instead of having to wait years. You can chop, change and fine tune much faster then you can with normal investing. </p>
<p>Making all the correct decisions is what investing, or poker, is all about. The mental challenge of competition, the financial risk and the possibility for reward all lure people into playing poker. But really what it boils down to is making decisions. If you make the correct decisions you will succeed. If you make less the perfect decisions you will learn very fast. After reading this Texas Hold Em Poker tip you should realise that every decision you make is vital to your poker game, and if you are making the wrong ones you need to fix this and make the correct ones.</p>

<p>Playing weak or marginal hands out of position. This is a very common poker mistake for new players.</p>
<p>#3</p>

<p>Not managing your money properly. Bankroll or stacks.</p>
<p>#5</p>

<p>#6</p>

<p>#14</p>
<p>Not sticking to your plan. Or not even having a plan.</p>
<p>#15</p>
<p>Using the autobet feature on line. See &#8211; telegraphing the strength of your hand.</p>

<p>Playing beyond the flop with nothing.</p>

<p>              Do you often get frustrated that you lose money playing poker? Well you need to learn these Texas Hold Em Poker tips for increasing winnings.</p>
<p>Learning Texas Hold Em Poker tips is a great way to quickly and effectively improve your poker game. With just a little bit of research and practice you can turn the tides of play and start winning more pots and money.</p>
<p>Texas Hold Em Poker Tips #1 &#8211; Play Aggressively</p>
<p>In my honest opinion, the biggest reason why someone would be winning easily and consistently is that they aren&#8217;t playing aggressive enough. Playing aggressive is pretty much a requirement these days. If you are at a very top level playing with professionals then checking, calling, check raises etc become viable, but for most people this just isn&#8217;t so.</p>
<p>If you are any sort of normal poker player, you need to be playing aggressive. Drastically reduce the amount of times you are checking and calling and you will massively increase how often you win and also the amount you do win. Don&#8217;t worry about the extra losses you may take having to pay a little extra to see a flop, for example, as the overall effects playing aggressive will do for your game will more than make up for it.</p>
<p>Texas Hold Em Poker Tips #2 &#8211; Utilise Table Position</p>
<p>The next second biggest mistake players make is the play the wrong cards at the wrong time. And by time I mean from the wrong position. When you are in late positions you can play a much larger range of cards than when you are in early positions. In early positions you should be playing a much tighter game.</p>
<p>When you play out of position you stack the odds against yourself. Winning is like an uphill battle. When in position these odds are in your favour, making winning a breeze. If you are having difficulties winning at poker it&#8217;s probably because you are accidently, or unwittingly, playing out of position.</p>
<p>Learning Texas Hold Em Poker tips is the fastest and easiest way to become good at poker. If you aren&#8217;t continually finding more tips to read and learn, and practice, you will not become good at poker. On the other hand, if you make it a habit of going out and getting your hands on more information on how to play Holdem better you will become a very good player quite quickly. Don&#8217;t pass up any chances to get more free tips. </p>
