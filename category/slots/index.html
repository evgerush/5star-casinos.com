			<a href="http://5star-casinos.com/the-pros-and-cons-of-video-slots" title="The Pros and Cons of Video Slots"></a><p><strong>The Pros and Cons of Video Slots</strong></p>
<p>Gamblers are always attracted towards the Video Slots. They are more attractive than the standard slots. New video slots are released very often. In this article, we will focus on the advantages, disadvantages and the differences between the reel slots and video slots.</p>
<p>&#13;<br />
Video Slots -&#13;</p>
<p>Video Slots uses a screen of a computer for displaying the reels. Generally, the video slots have 5 reels and come with 5 to up to 50 pay lines. Video Slots also offer an additional way to win some free spins or a bonus game.</p>
<p>&#13;<br />
The difference between Standard Slots and Video Slots –&#13;<br />
 &#13;</p>
<p>In Video slots, the coin sizes are in lower denominations while in the standard slots the coin sizes go up to . In Video Slots more winning combinations appear compared to the standard slots. All Video Slots have bonus games where as only few standards slots have this feature. And in Video slots, one can bet max with more than 1 coin per pay line.</p>
<p>&#13;<br />
Advantages of Video Slots –&#13;<br />
 &#13;</p>
<p>The best significant advantage of a Video Slot is the lower coin sizes. It is a great fun for just less amount of money. One can enjoy the excitement for hours by spending just some penny size coins.</p>
<p>&#13;<br />
Another great advantage of Video Slots is that they have a higher hit rate compared to the reel based slots. Unlike the standard slots, the Video Slots have more pay lines and more winning combinations.</p>
<p>&#13;<br />
The bonus games add a great excitement to the Video Slots. With the regular reel games the bonus games are limited while the video slots have no limit on the bonus games. Anything that can be done on a computer machine can be used as part of a bonus game. In Video slots, there are great animated second screen games.</p>
<p>&#13;<br />
Disadvantages of Video Slots –&#13;<br />
 &#13;</p>
<p>The best advantage of a Video Slot is also its biggest disadvantage. Mostly all games allow the player to bet with more than 1coin per pay line, so it results in a max bet of  even in a penny slot. However, it is not required to bet more than 1 coin per pay line. It is better to read the pay table before playing the game.</p>
<p>&#13;<br />
It is very critical to play with all the pay lines to avoid any regret as there can be nothing worse than coming up with the highest winning combination on a pay line that was not a part of the your bet. At the same time it is also very important to get the complete information about the game.</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>Now there is also a big myth that that a 5 reel based slot have more worse odd compared to a 3 reel based slot as there are more number of reels. But this is not true as the number of reels has nothing to do with the winning odds or pay out percentage. So, both a 3 reel game and a 5 reel game have the same pay out percentage.</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>Video Slots is a great option when it comes to stretching the bankroll as they have higher hit rate, a player gets longer gaming session for less even if he does not hit any big wins.</p>
<p>&#13;<br />
So, playing Video Slots is a great choice as the number of advantages is more than the number of disadvantages.</p>

<p><strong>Master yourself with Tips and Tricks on Online slots</strong></p>
<p>When describing online casinoâs slot games one would say they are easy to play, enjoyable, rewarding, and addictive. <strong>Online slots </strong>give you the chance to win considerable amounts of money with a single bet, making them more attractive to the average gambler. When you are playing online slots, you have an opportunity to hit the jackpot no matter what amount of money you bet with.</p>
<p>It is said that too many cooks spoil the broth. When it comes to online slots, however, the concept is reversed. The more money that is wagered on a specific slot, the higher the jackpot climbs. However, the player should also keep in mind that every time they spin an online slot, the spins have no bearing on the outcome of future spins.Â  Each spin is completely independent.</p>
<p>It is said that slot machines should not be played for long periods of time at once, due to the probability of losing. If a player constantly plays one the<strong> slot machine</strong>, there may be a high chance the âhouseâ will win. Apart from this, when we talk about online slot strategies, one thing is very essential: you should play the online slots that offer higher winning percentages. Further, if a slot machine accepts high denomination bets, the payouts of the slot machine are generally high as well. For example, a 25 cent slot machine will tend to have a higher payout than a 5 cent slot machine.</p>
<p>Among the various online slots, the progressive slots provide players with the <strong>biggest jackpots </strong><strong></strong>and rewards. Despite the great money-making opportunity, these progressive slots have their own disadvantages and should be dealt with wisely. In general, it is advisable to bet with a large amount of coins to increase the chance of a large payout.</p>
<p>Here are a few tips that could help when playing an online slot: 1) Make smaller bets when you are losing. 2) Make larger bets when winning. 3) Donât play down to your last coin!</p>
<p>Although online slots require somewhat of a trial and error approach when it comes to strategies, they are still one of the most popular online casino games. There isnât any sure fire way to beat online slots with the help of any strategy. The players just have to log into the casino and find out for themselves.</p>

<p>Slot machine players are interested in the dream of winning a big jackpot at an online casino with a relatively small initial investment. In that respect, casino slot machines have more in common with the lottery than they do with other online gambling games like craps or roulette. On a slot machine game, you might win 0,000 on a single  spin.</p>
<p><strong>Online casinos</strong> offer slot clubs where a percentage of each bet goes back into the players’ accounts in the form of rebates. And online slots can be networked with each other to form progressive jackpots, just like in an actual casino.</p>

			<a href="http://5star-casinos.com/different-types-of-payouts-for-online-slots-for-macs" title="Different Types of Payouts For Online Slots For Macs"></a><p><strong>Different Types of Payouts For Online Slots For Macs</strong></p>
<p>I hear online slot game players say they like a certain type of slot game because &#8220;it pays well&#8221;. By different types I am referring to different slots such as interactive bonus game slots for one and jackpot slot games as another type. Both very different and very distinct. Then there are one liner fruit slots which differ from a 5reel 20 bet line slot such as Excalibur, a NetEnt online slot game. Simple slot games like Excalibur are not interactive, do not have a jackpot nor are they an ancient one-liner.</p>
<p>&#13;Then other players will say they like &#8220;Champion of the Track&#8221; a NetEnt interactive slot game because &#8220;it Pays well&#8221;. A player can hit free spins and while in the free spin mode hit more free spins. It&#8217;s true. I have had a recent run of 30 free spins embedded inside each other and walked away with 7,000 euros. But then there are other types of slot game players who say they like jackpot slots best because they &#8220;payout well&#8221;. At the beginning of August a delighted Norwegian woman won an amazing 329,000 on the Tiki Wonders video slot. Tiki Wonders is one of 3 sister Wonder Jackpot Slots of NetEnt as well.</p>
<p>&#13;Who is right? Of the four categories of online slots:</p>
<p>&#13;* Interactive Slots<br />&#13;* Jackpot Slots<br />&#13;* Simple multi-line Slots<br />&#13;* One Line Slots</p>
<p>&#13;which pays better than the other?</p>
<p>&#13;MY QUESTION is from an empirical view point. I am not asking which is more popular or which has the highest jackpot amount What can we say about which is the best paying type of online slot game?</p>
<p>&#13;MY ANSWER from a strictly numbers view point is straight forward. You would simple have to look at the percentage payout. If a jackpot slot is paying 96.3% and a simple slot is paying out 96.9% then the obvious answer is the simple slot pays out better. The &#8220;Big Secret&#8221; to doing well in slots is looking at the Payout % and staying with the highest payer. Good Casinos post the monthly payouts over their online slot games.</p>
<p>&#13;But the reality is people think and experience life differently. It is the &#8220;way &#8221; these slots payout that they are focusing on. What these different players are experiencing is the psychological aspect of the type of slot. If we are a person who feels they need to escape into a better life. This psychological aspect embedded in the players character will focus him on the heavily laden Progressive or Accumulative Jackpots. Jackpots such as Arabian Nights, by NetEnt has a 2,808,789 Jackpot value as I write. But few people will experience this Jackpot. And everyone who doesn&#8217;t experience the winning is paying for the new life of &#8220;Joe&#8221; over there. The other side of the coin is &#8220;Boy! I would sure like to be Joe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#13;Compare this with a person who likes to maintain statuesque. Personally I love excitement and variety. But that does not make it &#8220;better&#8221; than stability. What I mean is a person who likes a steady life exactly the way it is, would enjoy an online slot game like Super Eighties. With Super Eighties the payout will be the same (96%) as the Arabian Night super Jackpot. The difference is that the money comes back to the players in a different way. So the same amount of money will eventually come back. The question is how? Will it be to one person every blue moon or will it be a steady payout all day long to the player behind the slot game doing the paying. Notice I said paying not playing.</p>
<p>&#13;Even the simple slot games that are in the same category can give you the money back in a different style. Tomorrow I will compare online slot game Supper Eighties with Spellcast two very simple 5 reel multiple bet line (20 lines and 40 lines respectively) online slot games. Yet the way they pay out is very different.</p>

			<a href="http://5star-casinos.com/advantages-of-playing-video-slots" title="Advantages of Playing Video Slots"></a><p><strong>Advantages of Playing Video Slots</strong></p>
<p>Video slots are becoming highly popular in the present times, with the old types of conventional slot machines being upgraded as online video slots. The advantage is that these video slots could be played from anywhere and at any time. Even though the online slots are somewhat similar in operation to the traditional slots where the handle is pulled to make three in a row, the video slots are much easier to play and provide lot of fun.</p>
<p>Previously the slot games were limited only to casinos and luxury yacht cruises. However, the Internet had made it possible for people to play this popular game from the comforts of their homes, in whichever corner of the world the live. The online video slots had been designed with stunning graphics and several winning combinations that create a terrific impression on the player. Since the video slots come in several types, you would be able to choose the video slot that suits your taste and talent. All these technical improvements help people play the online video slots with the least discomfort and have an enjoyable time whenever they are free of career or household work.</p>
<p>Another advantage with video slots is that many providers of such video slots offer lucrative and generous bonuses, along with additional cash awards for more time spent on playing these video slots. As such, the chances of earning more money are higher in the case of video slots, compared to the conventional slots. For most of the online video slots on the Internet, registration is free and a new player sign up bonus is offered. Moreover, you could even play some of the video slot games free of cost in several sites.</p>
<p>The video slots vary widely and you would be able to win anything like a few cents or even millions of dollars. The biggest money making opportunities exist in progressive jackpot slots. In these video slots, the jackpot amount increases progressively. The competition would be higher and the opponents would be tough persons but you could win large amounts if you have luck combined with your talent. Even if you had not tried the online video slots until now, it is time you tried your hand in them and check up your luck. The more time you spend on the video slots, the more are the chances of your winning higher amounts. Go ahead and have an enjoyable and relaxing period that could also be monetarily beneficial.</p>

Without being bothered of the land based casino dictates and without the threat of a lurker.<br />The rules and the direction for playing online slots is same as the brick and mortar slot casinos; yet online slots are becoming more lucrative to the players. In spite of the fact that land based casinos offer more range of slot machines with variety of slot games, the online slot casinos are booming like never before.</p>
<p>What is drawing the players to online slots?</p>
<p>There are few reasons why the online slots are drawing such huge traffic; few of the reason are as follows. <br />Saves your time: unlike in the land based casinos where you have to be in queue to get to a slot machine to begin playing, in the online slot casinos you do not have to wait neither to start your game nor for the attend to hand over your winning money.<br />Gaming anytime, anywhere: as a player you can access the online slot casinos anytime anywhere, it is 24X7 available.

<p>Like other casino games, online slots are also run under some rules. These rules are meant to make slots offer the same amount of fun and fair chances to win.</p>
<p>One thing though, a reputed online casino website like Cirrus Casino may alter these rules to give utmost satisfaction to their players. Ensure that you read the rules before you play slots online if you want to win attractive prizes like 200% match bonus or free sign up money or any thing like that.</p>
<p>The following are some common rules that are a part of most online slot games.</p>
<p>PayoutPercentage<strong><br /></strong><br />Online slot games are meant to pay a certain portion of the money that people wager on them. There is a set limit. A slot game cannot offer a payout percentage below the set limit. Following this rule, online slots games offer a payout percentage ranging from 75% to 98%. You should check the percentage of payout before you play slots online.</p>
<p><strong> Loose and Tight Slot Games</strong></p>
<p>On the basis of the payout percentage, we can classify the online slots as being loose or tight.</p>
<p><strong>Loose Online Slots<br /></strong>The slot games that offer a high rate of return are called loose slots. Often the rate of return range from 94% to 98%. Online casinos sometimes alter this limit as well to attract more and more players. Some casinos don&#8217;t mind offering a rate of return such as 99.9%!</p>
<p><strong>Tight Online Slots<br /></strong>The slot games that offer a low rate of return are called tight slots. The payout offered by these slots is not as high as offered by the loose slots. You may think it&#8217;s of no use to play such slots but that&#8217;s not true. Most tight slots offer huge jackpots. So even though the payout return is less, the value of jackpot covers up for it.</p>
<p><strong>Reels and Paylines</strong></p>
<p>Unlike traditional mechanical slots, online slot games offer more reels and paylines. Some online slots offer as many as 5 reels and 50 paylines. More paylines means more chances of winning! In fact, you can even win the attractive bonus offers and jackpots by playing slots at Cirrus Casino!</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t played such slots games so far, play free slots online for a while. Learn the game inside out and then play slot games online for money.Online slots are simple to play but you should always check the rules before starting a new session. All the best!</p>

			<a href="http://5star-casinos.com/new-slots-at-slots-prophet" title="New Slots At Slots Prophet"></a><p><strong>New Slots At Slots Prophet</strong></p>
<p><strong>SlotsProphet.com</strong>/ February 2, 2010/-Recently, many gambling and card game websites have started to increase the amount of games available at their sites. This trend follows suit with the popularity of online slots and the ease of access. The addition of these online slots games are an important factor to take into consideration when looking for a fun site to play at.</p>
<p>At <strong>SlotsProphet.com</strong>, players will find dozens of expertly rated and tested slots games online, as well as many accredited casinos that work through these companies directly. Slots machines are some of the most popular games at casinos in this day and age, so it pays, literally, to know which casinos and online sites have the best ones!</p>
<p>The appeal of online slot machines definitely includes ease of access, as these games can be played via web browser. On top of that, there is a huge selection of customized slots machines that you can play on. Being the highest profiting games at casinos, slots machines are found all over the world.</p>
<p>More recently, <strong>slots machines</strong> have become customized in the form of popular game shows and attractions. Some of these slots machines can include a Wheel of Fortune customization; The Price is Right look-alikes, and even themes like Cleopatra, which includes an Egyptian layout, (hieroglyphics included!).</p>
<p>At <strong>SlotsProphets.com</strong>, they rate some of the best slots games online. Some of these slots games include VIPSlots, which gives new players a 100% bonus on their first three deposits online. This means slots enthusiasts will double the amount of cash to start with on their slots games, adding more chances for that big win!</p>
<p>When signing up for VIPSlots, all players have to do is download their free gaming software to a computer and then boot it up to play. The software includes various slots machines and deposit capabilities for those who want to bet on progressive jackpots.</p>
<p>Another highly rated online slots machine found through SlotsProphet.com is that of SuperSlots. Superslots’ website has a plethora of slots machines, numbering to a total of 28 individual slots machines. Also included through this site is the ability to download their software and play the games by simply booting it up from your computer! Great sound effects, an awesome array of colorful games, and a great sense of security are included in this easy download.</p>
<p>Many websites are including actual pay-as-you-go slots machines that grant more and more cash wins as time goes on. Known as progressive jackpots, a progressive jackpot is a jackpot that gradually grows in size as players spin the slots machine more and more. Some of these jackpots can get ridiculously large, numbering in the multiple thousands or even millions of dollars. The best part about a progressive jackpot is that when you win, you get all your money back and then some!</p>
<p>Besides the hundreds of customized slots machines, there are also varying denominations of pay involved with slots. Some of these machines are nickel machines; some are quarter machines, numbering up to even five dollars at some of the pricier slots machines! One can surmise that the higher the denomination, the higher the payout when you win big!</p>
<p>Jumping back to <strong>SlotsProphet.com</strong> for a second, we can see that they run a pretty tight ship when it comes to who they recommend for slots machines and online gambling games. Some of the standards that these casinos have to meet for SlotsProphet.com to advertise them include the casino itself being fully licensed by their host country. Another requirement that casinos must meet for Slotsprophet.com to advertise them is that of the casino itself being registered with AND approved by various online gaming commissions.</p>
<p>The quality of slots machines can vary based on online play. Some of the machines might be more taxing on a slow system, or simply cannot run smoothly. To counter this, instead of playing via web browser, you can find a site that allows you to download the software for the slots machines and instead run it from your computer directly. This means that your computer will run the game much more smoothly than it would in a browser!</p>
<p>Countering slow and choppy game play is one of many concerns that SlotsProphet.com takes into account when suggesting online slots machines. SlotsProphet.com also is renowned for basing their recommendations on the promptness of payout by the casino in question that is running through the software. Rest assured that only the best slots machines will be recommended by <strong>SlotsProphet.com</strong> and that there will be many more exciting reviews to come!</p>

<p>Loose slots are largely a thing of the past in casinos. Slot machines work on different principles than they did in the early days of casino gambling. Random number generator or RNG technology revolutionized slots gambling and jackpots, making it possible for exponentially larger progressive jackpots. But RNG&#8217;s also eliminated the loose slot machine from the casino floor.</p>
<p>If loose slots ever existed, they disappeared from casino floors when slots became electronic instead of mechanical. Still, some of the old slots myths continue to this day, as old assumptions gain the respectability of age and are printed on how-to websites around the world. Let me discuss a couple of the most pervasive myths about loose slots.</p>
<p>The Zig Zag Method</p>
<p>The Zig-Zag Method is one of the more famous ways people try to find loose slots. I&#8217;ve never read for certain how the term &#8220;zigzag&#8221; came to refer to this method. One theory is the gamblers zig zags through the casino looking for the right slot machine. Another is that the gambler is looking for zig zag patterns on the slots reels. Whatever the case, the zig zag method has no basis in fact.</p>
<p>In the Zig Zag system, a player looks for specific patterns of reel symbols on the slot machine reels. As an example, let&#8217;s imagine that 7&#8242;s are the jackpot symbols on a slot machine. The zig zag gambler walks through the casino searching for a machine with the right pattern of 7&#8242;s on the reels. If two 7&#8242;s are on the payline and a third is one line off of the payline, this is considered a zig zag. In the theory, the reels are starting to line up. If you start to bet on that machine, you&#8217;ll soon hit a big jackpot.</p>
<p>Now, maybe the zig zag method had a purpose in the days of mechanical slots. Maybe players could read reels and see them lining up, though I&#8217;m still not sure I buy that. I can absolutely tell you that reels don&#8217;t &#8220;line up&#8221; on a modern slot machines.</p>
<p>Modern slot machines use random number generators. These random number generators are internal computers which tabulate probabilities and determine which reel symbols to display. Every time you make a bet and hit the button on a slot machine, a random number generator determines the positions of the machine&#8217;s reel symbols.</p>
<p>That means each and every spin on a slot machine is independent of all other spins. The random number generator randomizes every spin. That&#8217;s why they call it random.</p>
<p>Loose Slots Near the Door</p>
<p>One common theory is that casinos place &#8220;loose&#8221; slots near the doors of the casino. Gamblers coming into the casino see other players winning at the slots and decide they want to play. In this theory, slots gamblers should always play the machines near the entrances and exits of casinos, since these are the loosest slots.</p>
<p>Another variation of this method is that casinos place loose machines in the areas most visited, like near the cashiers, the restrooms or the casino gaming table. So, instead of gambling at the machines near the front entrance, you should play the machines where casino traffic is heaviest.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s one flaw in this theory, which is the idea of slot machines&#8217; &#8220;hit frequency&#8221;. A hit ratio is the percentage of spins that a machine pays off instead of takes your money. The thing is, one machine might have a higher hit frequency, while another slot machine might have fewer hits, but pay off more when those hits happen.</p>
<p>Keeping this in mind, a casino could place a machine with a high hit frequency near an entrance or heavily walked spot, but that doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean the machine is paying off more than machines in other parts of the casino. In fact, it could be just the opposite. Casinos aren&#8217;t in the business of just giving away money, so they will come up with inventive ways to get the same results.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t expect to see a loose slot machine near a door. In fact, casino managers know about these myths. If anything, the casino might place slots with smaller payback percentages where gamblers are more likely to sit down.</p>
