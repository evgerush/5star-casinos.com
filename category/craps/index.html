		<div class="post-info"><span class="date time published" title="2010-11-06T05:37:01+0000">November 6, 2010</span>  By <span class="author vcard"><a href="http://5star-casinos.com/author/5 Star Rated Casinos/" title="Posts by 5 Star Rated Casinos" rel="nofollow">5 Star Rated Casinos</a></span> <span class="post-comments"><a href="http://5star-casinos.com/learn-to-play-casino-craps-the-craps-lay-bet#comments" rel="nofollow">Leave a Comment</a></span> </div>		<div class="entry-content">
			<a href="http://5star-casinos.com/learn-to-play-casino-craps-the-craps-lay-bet" title="Learn to Play Casino Craps: the Craps Lay Bet"></a><p><strong>Learn to Play Casino Craps: the Craps Lay Bet</strong></p>
<p>Be smart, play smart, learn how to play casino craps the right way!</p>
<p>The Lay bet is for the 7 against your chosen number (i.e., the 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10) and the payoff is according to true odds.  It&#8217;s the opposite of the Buy bet, much like the Don&#8217;t Pass is the opposite of the Pass line.  For example, if you Lay the 10, you hope a 7 shows before the 10; whereas, if you Buy the 10, you hope a 10 shows before the 7.</p>
<p>The Lay bet pays off according to true odds, which are: 1:2 for the 4 and 10, 2:3 for the 5 and 9, and 5:6 for the 6 and 8.  For example, the payoff odds for Laying the 10 are 1:2, which means you have to bet more money than you win.  For every two dollars you bet, you win one dollar.  It&#8217;s like the Don&#8217;t Pass where you have the advantage over the house because there are six ways to make a 7 and only three ways to make a 10.  Therefore, you have to put up your fair share, which is twice the amount you hope to win.  So, if your  Lay bet on the 10 wins, you win .</p>
<p>The Lay bet has the same vig as the Buy bet, but it&#8217;s based on the win amount, not the bet amount.  For example, suppose you Lay the 4 for 0.  The true payoff odds are 1:2, which means your winning 0 Lay bet pays .  The vig is based on the  winnings, not the 0 bet.  So, the vig is  ( x 5% = .50, which is rounded down to ), instead of  (0 x 5% = ).</p>
<p>Lay bets are often called &#8220;No&#8221; bets.  For example, suppose you play for three hours and not a single 5 shows.  You decide you&#8217;re in a weird, anomalous blip of the distribution where the number 5 just isn&#8217;t going to show no matter what the craps gods do.  You want to take advantage of that anomaly so you drop  in the Come box and tell the dealer, &#8220;Give me a No five, please.&#8221;  The dealer moves your chips to the 5 point box and puts a LAY button on top. Lay bets are positioned in the same locations as Don&#8217;t Come with Odds bets.  Sure enough, the 5 doesn&#8217;t show and the shooter rolls a 7-out.  Your  Lay bet wins  (i.e., the true odds are 2:3, so  divided by 3 = , multiplied by 2 = ).  You must also pay the 5% vig on your winnings.  To make it easier for himself, the dealer will likely give you two  chips for your winnings and say, &#8220;Drop me two dollars, please,&#8221; rather than count out  in chips.  In this case, you simply drop two  chips in the Come box and then pick up your two  chips.</p>
<p>Unlike Buy bets, Lay bets are kept on and working on the come-out roll of a new game.  However, you can always turn them off and on whenever you want.  Typically, players leave their Lay bets on and working for the come-out roll because they have the advantage over the house (i.e., there are always more ways to make a 7 than any of the point numbers).  Another reason&#8211;a silly reason, but a reason nonetheless&#8211;is because everyone is typically rooting for a 7 on the come-out (most people play the Pass Line, so a 7 on the come-out is a winner for them).  With all that positive mojo at the table, a 7 is bound to show, so leave your Lay bets working for the come-out roll of a new game.  Seriously, you should leave your Lay bets working on the come-out not because of table mojo, but because you have the advantage over the house.</p>
<p>Now you know!  Remember, learn how to play casino craps the right way.</p>

			<a href="http://5star-casinos.com/getting-to-know-craps-betting-system" title="Getting to Know Craps Betting System"></a><p><strong>Getting to Know Craps Betting System</strong></p>
<p>Craps is considered to be one of the most exciting casino games, mainly due to the fast game execution. One or more players can win on just a single dice roll, and can also lose in that instant. It all depends on how lucky they are. Another thing that adds to the excitement of craps is the numerous ways on how to bet your money. </p>
<p> Craps is played by rolling a dice. By the way, for those who don&#8217;t have an idea about it, a die (singular of dice) is a cube shaped object (often made of wood or plastic) with dots engraved on all 6 sides: each side represents the numbers 1 to 6 by the count of dots, ie, one dot represents number 1, two dots is 2, etc. When the dice is rolled, the numbers on the sides of the two dice which are facing top are added and termed as the dice outcome. The shooter of the dice can either win or lose depending on the following situations: </p>
<p> &#8211; Natural: If the shooter rolls the dice and the first dice outcome, which is called the come out roll, is a number 7 or 11, then he wins the game. </p>
<p> &#8211; Craps: If the come out roll is either 2, 3, or 12, then the shooter loses, but still rolls the dice. </p>
<p> &#8211; Point: If any number other than the already mentioned is the come out roll, then a point is established, and the shooter must roll the same number before a number 7 in order to win. </p>
<p> &#8211; 7-out: If a point is established and number 7 is rolled first before the point number is rolled </p>
<p> Depending on the dice outcomes, casinos offer a very wide variety of betting rules where players can place their bets. Online casino craps also provides online gamers with more or less the same number of craps betting variants. The shooter of the dice is mainly the center of attraction in playing craps. Players can place their bet on two main betting categories: line bets and side bets. </p>
<p> Line bets are the most fundamental and basic bets in the game. This type of bet is resolved with reference to the winning or losing situation of the dice shooter. </p>
<p> 1. Pass Line bet is the bet made by the players where they root on the dice shooter. If the dice shooter wins, then the pass line bet also wins. The bet loses on Craps and 7-out, together with the shooter. </p>
<p> 2. Don&#8217;t Pass Line bet is the opposite: if the shooter lose either on Craps (except number12) or 7-out, then the Don&#8217;t Pass Line bet win. If the shooter&#8217;s come out roll is 12, then it is considered as draw. The bet loses on Natural and if the shooter obtains the point number first before a 7. </p>
<p> 3. Come bet is made after a point is established, and it applies the same rules as the Pass Line bet. However, if the shooter rolled a 7 upon placing the Come bet, then the come bet wins, but the shooter loses, together with the Pass Line and Come bets made before it. </p>
<p> 4. Don&#8217;t Come bet is the opposite of Come bet, and applies the same rules as the Don&#8217;t Pass Line Bet. </p>
<p> Odds bets are bets made to reinforce the Pass Line and Don&#8217;t Pass Line bets, as well as the Come and Don&#8217;t Come bets. </p>
<p> Side bets, also called Proposition bets, are bets on craps that are based on the outcomes of the dice rolls. There are three types of side bets, namely, the Single-roll bets, Multi-roll bets, and the Player bet. </p>
<p> Single-roll bets are those that are resolved on a single dice roll. <br />- Aces or Snake Eyes &#8211; bet that number 2 will be rolled <br />- Boxcars, Cornrows, or Midnight &#8211; bet for number 12 <br />- Ace-Deuce &#8211; bet for number 3 <br />- Yo &#8211; bet for number 11 <br />- Hi-Lo &#8211; bet that either number 2 or 12 will be rolled <br />- Any Craps or Three-Way &#8211; bet for either 2, 3, or 12 <br />- Any Seven &#8211; bet for number 7 <br />- C &amp; E &#8211; combined bet for both Any Craps and Yo (11), where only one of the two bets may win <br />- Field bet &#8211; bet where the player wins on either 3, 4, 9, 10, or 11, and wins double on 2 and 12, but loses if the dice outcome is either 5, 6, 7, or 8 <br />- Horn bet &#8211; a bet for each of the numbers 2, 3, 11, and 12 at the same time, which results to four separate bets where only one of the bets may win <br />- Whirl bet or World bet &#8211; the Horn bet + Any Seven bet, resulting to a five-unit bet for each of the numbers of the Horn and the number 7. If number 7 wins, it is a draw or push, because the bets lost on the Horn is won in the number 7. <br />- On the Hop &#8211; bet on any resulting combination of the come out roll, such as 3-5, 4-2, 3-3, etc. A player can choose whether to bet on double numbers (2-2, 3-3, etc.) or different numbers (3-5, 2-3, etc.) </p>
<p> Multi-roll bets are bets that are resolved by one or more dice rolls. <br />- Place bet &#8211; a bet on any of the point numbers (4, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10) to be rolled before a 7 <br />- Buy bet &#8211; a bet similar to the Place bet, butwith better payouts for a 5% commision charge if it wins <br />- Lay bet &#8211; a bet on any of the point numbers (4, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10), in which it wins if number 7 is rolled first before the number, and is charged a 5% commision <br />- Big 6 &#8211; a bet on number 6 to be rolled before 7 <br />- Big 8 &#8211; a bet on number 8 to be rolled before 7 <br />- Hard Way &#8211; a bet on one of the numbers 4, 6, 8, or 10 to be rolled, with the dice showing similar numbers, before the number 7 <br />- Easy Way &#8211; bet for one of the numbers 4, 6, 8, or 10 to be rolled, with the dice showing different numbers, before number 7 </p>
<p> A Player bet is a bet placed on the dice shooters. The Fire bet is one type of player bet, where the players can bet on one or more point numbers to be obtained and won by the shooter in more than three times in a row. </p>
<p> It is essential to know where to put your bets if you want to enjoy and win on both offline and online casino craps. On the mentioned craps betting rules, the best way for you to play longer is to bet on the Pass Line and Come bets, and frequently reinforcing with odds bet, for they offer the best winning situations. Even though Don&#8217;t Pass Line and Don&#8217;t Come bets have a higher chance of winning compared to the former, most experienced players avoid these bets because they don&#8217;t like to be in contrast of the dice shooter. </p>
<p> Most of the time, proposition bets are considered to be bad bets because of the very high advantages of the house in taking your money. The payouts offered are very large in some, but there are only small chances of winning. Big 6 and Big 8 are avoided by experienced craps players, because these bets can be paid better in Place 6 and Place 8 bets in similar winning odds. </p>
<p> Craps is a vary fast game. Playing on online casino craps is very much faster, compared to brick and mortar casino craps, because everything is programmed: the dice can produce faster results and the bets are processed instantly. Online craps is best suited for those players who want to win and lose money fast.</p>

			<a href="http://5star-casinos.com/how-to-play-craps" title="How to Play Craps"></a><p><strong>How to Play Craps</strong></p>
<p>How to play craps or shoot dice is rather easy to learn and then progress to more sophisticated methods of play. Craps is all about the number seven which on a pair of dice is made up of 3-4 or 2-5 or 1-6. The shooter or the roller of the dice makes what is called the come out roll. If the dice come up seven or eleven on that first roll, the shooter and all who bet on the pass line will win. It the roll is a 2 or a 3 or a 12, the pass line bets lose. If the roll comes up any other number that number becomes what is called the point. The pass line bet is a winner if the number repeats before a seven is rolled. If the dreaded seven comes up first then the pass line bets all lose.</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>The first simple strategy is to take advantage of the odds offered in a craps game. A player makes their first bet on the pass line and either wins, loses or gets a point. If a point number is rolled, the player should take behind the line odds on the point. Each casino has its own rules as to what they will accept on a behind the line bet. Just ask the stick man or a dealer what their limit is and then bet it. If the table gets hot, the dice will roll many numbers and few untimely sevens. A really hot table will also roll many hard way numbers like four, six, eight and ten. These are called hardways, as the dice are pairs of twos, threes, fours or fives.</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>A table of dice payoffs is the next thing that a player should learn as this is where the money is made when a dice table gets hot. (these payoff numbers can be obtained on the Internet or on many online casino sites) When a table is showering the players with numbers, the player should be making all of these number bets at odds.</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>These bets can be of two types, all day bets and single roll bets. All day bets stay up in play until a seven is rolled. A single roll bet either wins or loses on the next roll. The better bet unless the player has a strong hunch is the all day bet.</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>If a player knew nothing about craps except to bet the pass line and take the max behind the line bet on all points, then they would play better than most craps players. When a player adds to this betting on the come line and placing bets, they have most of the reasonable bets covered that the craps table offers to a player. </p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>The rule in craps is to push the devil out of a hot table and parlay bets, take the odds and keep all of the number bets covered until the table cools down. More money can be made on a hot craps table faster than any other casino game. Players who know how to play craps make a killing when they find a hot table.</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>The secret to recognizing a hot table early is each shooter holds the dice for a number of passes. Certain shooters hold the dice for much longer than normal and throw many numbers in a row before making their point. Hardways become common and all of this is going on without many sevens being rolled. The lack of sevens is another clue that the table is moving in favor of the craps players.</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>Be alert to these runs of numbers and which shooters seem to be lucky. Then make the bets and watch your stack grow as the table goes from warm to hot.</p>

			<a href="http://5star-casinos.com/craps-history" title="Craps History"></a><p><strong>Craps History</strong></p>
<p>The historian may have a little trouble clearly defining the history of Craps. In some circles, Craps has a debatable history. I found it fairly challenging to trace the game of Craps back to one single origin.</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>If popularity is to rule the day, then we should go with a widely accepted origin. It&#8217;s largely accepted that Craps evolved from an old game called Hazard, which was allegedly created by Bernard de Mandeville.</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>While his name might sound French, Hazard didn&#8217;t come into being in France or even Europe. Nope. Hazard was forged right in the USA. The time was 1813 and the place was none other than party town New Orleans-figures right? As the legend goes, Hazard grew in popularity. </p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>And here&#8217;s something to completely throw you. Many found Hazard to be too complicated, so they simplified it. The new name? Craps. Many people today think Craps is extremely complicated. Can you imagine what Hazard must be like? The tables in Vegas would be barren-only a couple rocket scientists here and there. Come on baby, daddy needs a new pocket protector.</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>In the glory years, Craps was part of American culture. It was played in casinos and on many American streets. It was a game that was at least known about by most of society. And then the fall came. Some believe that gamblers just don&#8217;t want to think much. They want to put their money down and have a set path with limited choices. The popularity decline of Craps over the past 20 years would seem to support this theory.</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>Craps&#8217; decline helped give rise to other games-like Blackjack. In the early 1990s, Las Vegas casinos experimented with a simpler version of Craps. Many of the decisions were taken out and it was more of a carnival came. There was one dealer-think Blackjack table here. You&#8217;d make a bet and throw the dice. It failed.</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>Real Craps players weren&#8217;t interested in the novelty game and non-Craps players just didn&#8217;t give a, well, crap. The casinos saw that there wasn&#8217;t any real money in the game and ditched it.</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>I think the game failed, because of one critical issue-community. Most real world Craps players play the game, because of the atmosphere. They want to be where the action is. Also, they want others to throw the dice to mix things up. There&#8217;s nothing better than a full table of happy Craps players. No matter where you are in the casino, you&#8217;ll hear the shouts.</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>Craps also has an interesting twist. An empty table is hard to fill. Craps players go where other Craps players are. Take a look at any other game, like Blackjack. An empty table can be a welcomed sight. There&#8217;s no other game as passionate as Craps.</p>

			<a href="http://5star-casinos.com/learn-to-play-casino-craps-the-place-bet" title="Learn to Play Casino Craps: the Place Bet"></a><p><strong>Learn to Play Casino Craps: the Place Bet</strong></p>
<p>Be smart, play smart, learn how to play casino craps the right way!</p>
<p>A Place bet is a &#8220;standing&#8221; bet, meaning the bet stays working, or standing, until it wins or loses, or until you remove it.  A Place bet can be made on any of the point numbers: 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10.  Like the Pass Line bet, a Place bet works against the number 7.  After making a Place bet, the only numbers that matter are the Place number and 7; all other numbers are meaningless.  After making a Place bet, each subsequent roll can produce one of three outcomes: 1) a 7 shows and your Place bet loses, 2) the Place number shows and your Place bet wins, or 3) any other number shows and nothing happens to your Place bet (i.e., all others number have no affect on your Place bet).</p>
<p>Place bets don&#8217;t pay off according to true odds.  Instead, the house gets its advantage by paying them off at less than true odds (i.e., they stick it to the player by not paying their fair share when the player wins).</p>
<p>The Place odds aren&#8217;t quite as good as true odds.  The house sticks it to the player to make money by paying less than true odds.  For a winning  bet on the 4 or 10, the Place odds pay only , but the true odds say we should be paid .  For a winning  bet on the 5 or 9, the Place odds pay only , but the true odds say we should be paid .  And for a winning  bet on the 6 or 8, the Place odds pay only , but the true odds say we should be paid .</p>
<p>You might think, &#8220;How much do I put down to make a Place bet?&#8221;  As always, the bet amount depends on the odds.  The Place odds for the 4 and 10 are 9:5, and the Place odds for the 5 and 9 are 7:5.  Therefore, Place bets for the 4, 5, 9, and 10 should be in multiples of .  For example, a winning  Place bet on the 4 gets you .  A winning  Place bet on the 9 gets you .  Don&#8217;t let the math scare you!  Since these bets are in multiples of , simply divide your bet by 5 and then multiply by the winning odds to determine your winning amount.  So, for your  Place bet on the 4 (which has Place odds of 9:5),  divided by 5 = , and  x 9 = .  For your  Place bet on the 9 (which has Place odds of 7:5),  divided by 5 = , and  x 7 = .</p>
<p>The Place odds for the 6 and 8 are 7:6, which means the bet should be in multiples of .  For example, a winning  Place bet on the 6 gets you .  A winning  Place bet on the 8 gets you .  Do the math.  For your  Place bet on the 8 (which has Place odds of 7:6),  divided by 6 = , and  x 7 = .</p>
<p>Know the difference between Place odds and true odds.  Learn the difference so you don&#8217;t have to think about it.  You don&#8217;t want to look like a newbie fumbling around with how much to put down for each Place number.  (James Bond never asked the dealer, &#8220;Um, excuse me, how much is the six?&#8221;)  However, if you have trouble remembering the Place odds the first time you play, don&#8217;t be afraid to ask the dealer how much to drop.  It&#8217;ll be as easy as pie after 15 minutes at the table.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re like me, you&#8217;ll search out and play a table with a  minimum bet instead of the typical  or  minimum.  Suppose you find a  table (a few are still left in the middle of the Vegas Strip).  Since the minimum bet is only , you can make  Place bets, but you don&#8217;t get the full Place odds.  The payoff odds for a  Place bet on the 6 or 8 are 1:1, or even money.  For the 5 or 9, it&#8217;s 4:3 (i.e., your  bet wins ).  For the 4 or 10, it&#8217;s 5:3 (i.e., your  bet wins ).</p>
<p>For a  Place bet, you get a little less than full Place odds because the lowest chip denomination at the craps table that casinos allow is generally , so they can&#8217;t pay you a fraction of a dollar (i.e., cents).  For example, suppose you make a  Place bet on the 5.  The full Place odds are 7:5, but the reduced payoff odds for a  bet are only 4:3.  Why?  Because it gives the casino another excuse to stick it to the player!  The roulette table has chips for 25 cents or 50 cents, so why can&#8217;t the craps table have chip denominations less than ?  That&#8217;s right.  They stick it to you again!  The full Place odds are 7:5, which means for a  Place bet on the 5, we divide  by 5 = 60 cents, and then multiply 60 cents by 7 = .20.  So, for a  Place bet on the 5 or 9 with full Place odds of 7:5, we expect to be paid .20 when we win.  The craps table doesn&#8217;t have 20-cent chips, so the casino rounds down to .</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at a  Place bet on the 4 or 10.  The full Place odds are 9:5, which means we divide  by 5 = 60 cents, and then multiply 60 cents by 9 = .40.  So, for a  Place bet on the 4 or 10 with full Place odds of 9:5, we expect to win .40, but the casino rounds down to .  (Notice how the casino rounds down instead of up.)  The player isn&#8217;t giving up much by making  Place bets, so if you have a limited bankroll, these bets are fun and give you more action than just Pass Line bets.  The point is, be aware that you get a little less than full Place odds and increase the house advantage when you make  Place bets.</p>
<p>Full Place odds aren&#8217;t as good as true odds.  That&#8217;s how the house maintains its advantage.  Remember, the house is in business to make money, not to gamble.  Over time, the house wins because when you lose, you pay the true odds; but when you win, the house pays you less than true odds.  So, by paying less than their fair share when you win, the house can&#8217;t help but come out a winner over the long haul.  Let&#8217;s look closer at how the house sticks it to the player.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at the number 4.  The true odds for making a 4 compared to a 7 are 1:2 (i.e., three ways to make a 4 compared to six ways to make a 7, which is 3:6, which reduces down to 1:2).  Therefore, since the number 7 is twice as easy to make as a 4, we expect to get paid twice as much as our bet when we win.  For example, if we bet  on the 4 to hit before the 7, we expect to get  when we win (i.e.,  x 2 = ).  However, for a Place bet on the 4, the payoff odds are only 9:5.  This is close to 2:1, but not quite.  Therefore, if we make a  Place bet on the 4 and win, the house pays us only .  When the house loses, they don&#8217;t pay the true odds; they pay only  instead of  and keep that extra dollar.  You might think, &#8220;For my  bet, I win , so I don&#8217;t care if they screw me out of that extra .  It&#8217;s only a buck.&#8221;  Okay, but think of it this way.  That&#8217;s only one Place bet made by one player during one game.  Imagine keeping that extra dollar when other people at the table make that same bet, multiplied by the number of tables in action, multiplied by the number of hours in a day, multiplied by the number of days in a month, and so on.  It&#8217;s easy to see how the house rakes in the money over the long haul.</p>
<p>You can make or remove Place bets at any time during a game.  You can also make them while the puck is OFF (before a new come-out roll), but typically, dealers prefer that you wait until a point is established and then make your Place bets.  Occasionally, you see a player try to make a Place bet while the puck is OFF by asking, &#8220;Can you Place the six for me now, please, so I don&#8217;t forget after the come-out?&#8221;  The dealer usually obliges (as he should; after all, you&#8217;re the customer), but sometimes a dealer in a bad mood will ask the player to wait until a point is established.</p>
<p>Dealers who ask you to wait to make a Place bet until after a point is established do so because they&#8217;re lazy.  Suppose you Place the 6 before the come-out and the dealer moves your chip into the 6 point box.  The shooter then rolls a 6 for the point.  The dealer moves the ON puck into the 6 point box, and then has to ask, &#8220;Sir, what do you want to do with your six?&#8221;  Since your Pass Line bet covers the 6 (because 6 is now the point), you likely don&#8217;t want it covered again by your Place bet.  The dealer then has to move your Place 6 to whatever other number you want, or return it to you if you decide to take it down.  You think, &#8220;Gee, wow, that sure is a lot of extra work for the dealer.&#8221;  You&#8217;re right, it&#8217;s no effort at all, but it&#8217;s amazing how many dealers&#8211;even good ones&#8211;don&#8217;t like moving your Place bets around because you couldn&#8217;t wait until after the point was established to make them.</p>
<p>You can make as many Place bets as you want, up to a maximum of six (i.e., the 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10), including the point.  Yes, you can Place the point.  For example, suppose you walk up to a table and see an ON puck in the 6 point box (i.e., a game is in progress and the shooter&#8217;s point is 6).  Suppose you love the number 6 and you want immediate action, but you don&#8217;t want to make a Put bet so you decide to Place the shooter&#8217;s point.  To do this, place your chips centered directly on the bottom line of the Pass Line (i.e., the line that separates the Pass Line from the apron).  As long as you center your chips on that line, the dealer knows it&#8217;s a Place bet on the shooter&#8217;s point instead of Put bet in the Pass Line.  If you don&#8217;t want to make your Place bet this way, simply drop your chips in the Come box and tell the dealer, &#8220;Place the point, please.&#8221;  The dealer then moves your chips to the point box.</p>
<p>The dealer positions all Place bets (except when you Place the shooter&#8217;s point yourself), so you have to put your chips on the table and tell the dealer what you want.  Then, the dealer puts them in the proper position in the point box for the number you want to Place.  To an untrained eye, players&#8217; chips appear to be scattered all over the point boxes.  To the contrary, it&#8217;s well organized.  Each player position has a corresponding chip position for each point box.  The same is true for Lay bets, Come bets, and Don&#8217;t Come bets.  For all bets in and around the point boxes, players&#8217; chip locations correspond to their positions at the table.</p>
<p>Now you know!  Remember, learn how to play casino craps the right way.</p>

<p>Huh?  What did he say?  What does that mean?  As a novice standing by the table watching, too nervous to jump in, you give up trying to understand this wacky game.  Your Chinese language class in college was easier to understand than all this craps jargon.  So, instead of having a blast at the craps table, you take your 0 and pee it away in a slot machine.  Twenty minutes later, you stare at the machine thinking, “That was stupid.  Why am I so afraid to play?”</p>
<p>It shouldn’t be like that.  Craps is so easy and so much fun.  Trust me; you don’t have to be a brain surgeon or math professor to play.  Don’t let your fear of the unknown keep you away.</p>
<p>You don’t have to speak craps fluently to play.  You just need to know a few basic words and phrases.  As you play, your command of the language will develop quickly.  Don’t waste time trying to memorize every term before deciding to play.  Always remember, if you don’t understand something, just ask the dealer for help.</p>
<p>The following terms cover the letters A to B in alphabetical order.  Craps terms beginning with other letters are defined in my other articles.</p>
<p>Aces = Two one’s.  Known as snake eyes or eyeballs.<br />Action = Bets that are in play or live.  Also, how busy a table is.<br />Any Craps = A bet that the next roll will be a 2, 3, or 12.<br />Any Seven = A bet that the next roll will be a 7.<br />Apron = The outer edge of the table layout.  The plain, unmarked area closest to the player.<br />At Risk = Cheques (money) that are in play or live.<br />Australian Yo = The number 3.  When a 3 shows, the opposite number (i.e., the number on the bottom of the dice) is 11, which is “down under.”  On dice, 1 is opposite the 6, 2 is opposite the 5, and 3 is opposite the 4.  So, when a 1-2 shows, the opposite side (i.e., the bottom of the dice, “down under”) is 6-5.<br />Back Line =  The Don’t Pass line.<br />Back Wall = The inside end of the table against which the shooter must roll the dice for the roll to be considered valid.<br />Bank = All the casino’s cheque stacks on the table in front of the boxman.<br />Barber Pole A stack of cheques with a variety of denominations mixed together.  Cheques should be stacked with higher-denominations on the bottom and lower-denominations on top.<br />Big Eight = An even-money bet that an 8 will appear before a 7.<br />Big Red = A bet that the next roll will be a 7 (same as Any Seven).<br />Big Six = An even-money bet that a 6 will appear before a 7.<br />Black = 0 cheques.<br />Bones = The dice.<br />Bowl = The plastic, wood, or metal bowl the stickman uses to hold unused dice.<br />Box Number = The numbers 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10 that can become a point on the come-out roll.  All other numbers (i.e., 2, 3, 7, 11, and 12) are called naturals because they result in a decision on the come-out roll.  Also, called point number.<br />Boxcars = The number 12.  A bet that the next roll will be a 12.  Also called midnight.<br />Boxman = The person supervising the game who sits between the two dealers and across from the stickman.<br />Boys, the = The dealers.<br />Broke Money = Money the casino gives a broke person for transportation home.<br />Brooklyn Forest = Two three’s.  A Hard 6.<br />Buffalo = A bet on all of the Hardways and the Any Seven.<br />Buffalo Yo = A bet on all of the Hardways and the number 11.<br />Bump = An extra break for a dealer because the shift is overstaffed relative to the number of tables/games in play.<br />Buy = A bet and paying a 5% vigorish (or tax) for the privilege of getting true odds that a number will show before a 7.</p>

			<a href="http://5star-casinos.com/how-to-calculate-the-house-edges-for-any-craps-bet" title="How to Calculate the House Edges For &#8220;Any Craps&#8221; Bet"></a><p><strong>How to Calculate the House Edges For &#8220;Any Craps&#8221; Bet</strong></p>
<p>Online Craps has a variety of bets that players can play on. However, not all bets have equal advantage to the house and the players. There are some bets are more favourable to the players with less house edge while others bets are the sucker bets, which have higher house advantages.</p>
<p>In order to maximize the chance of winning on each bet, you need to know the correct criteria in choosing the favourable bets. To help you in identifying the correct criteria, you need to know how to calculate the house edges for Craps bets. Off course, the calculation of exact house edge on each type of bet may involve complicated compilation.</p>
<p>In a simple term, a house edge is the percent of a wager that goes to the casino in the long run. This figure sometimes refers as the casino advantage that guarantees a profit to a casino. The higher the figure, the less favourable is the wager for the players. If you want to stay at the maximum chance of winning at Online Craps, you should always bet on the bets with minimum house edges.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s explore the simple calculation of house edge for Any Crap bets:</p>
<p>The house edge calculation involves two important factors: the probability and the payout. You need to know these two factors in order to calculate the house edge for Craps bets. In craps there are 11 outcomes (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 &amp; 12) can be generated from the two dices, which can be achieved in 36 different ways. Let&#8217;s say any craps is 2, 3 and 12. A total of 2 can be achieved in one way when the two dices draw a 1; therefore a probability to achieve 2 is 1/36. A total of 3 can be achieved in 2 ways and a total of 12 can be achieved only in 1 way. Therefore, any craps can be achieved in 4 ways, making it has a probability of 4/36 or 1/9. The common payout for any crap bet is 7 in 1. This means that if you wager  and Any Craps is rolled, you will win , else you will lose .</p>
<p>With the probability and the payout of any craps are known, the house edge for any craps bet can be calculated. In the long run in betting on any craps, a player will win once and lose eight times because the probability for any craps is 1/9. In other words, it means if a player wager for 9 times, every time he bets  on any craps, he will win one time and get  from casino and lose 8 times to casino that costs him ; he is making a net loss of  to the casino. Therefore, the house edge for any craps bet would be 1/9 (win one, lose 8), if expresses in percent would be 11.11%.</p>
<p>You will know how to compile the house edge for other bets in Craps game, such as &#8220;any seven&#8221; bet, which can be calculated in a similar way once you know how to calculate the house edge for any craps bet.</p>
