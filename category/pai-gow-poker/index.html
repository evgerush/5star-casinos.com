<p>Double-hand poker, Chinese domino card game, Pai Gow â these are some of the other names that Pai Gow is known for. If you&#8217;re looking for a unique casino card game, this is definitely it for you. </p>
<p>Basically, Pai Gow is derived from the Chinese domino game of the same name. However, instead of playing the game using dominoes like the Chinese do, Pai Gow is played using cards. If you&#8217;re still having problems picturing exactly how the game is played, let us compare it with the more popular card game Blackjack. Unlike Blackjack which is a swift kind of casino card game, Pai Gow is played a bit more slowly. If you want to increase your chances of winning, you need to invest in a longer amount of play time. </p>
<p>How the Game is Played </p>
<p>With Pai Gow, you will be utilizing all your 52 cards plus an additional Joker card.Â  Your objective as a player is to create two poker hands out of the seven cards that you will be receiving. As such, a previous knowledge of the traditional poker game is definitely a plus. The dealer will place seven facedown piles containing seven cards each. </p>
<p>The maximum number of players for Pai Gow is seven, and the rule of thumb to follow is that the remaining cards will remain unused no matter how many people are playing. Once the cards are distributed, each player should make a two hands out of the seven cards they are dealt with. The five-card hand is ranked similar to the five-card draw poker game â while the two-card hand is ranked as pairs or whichever card is higher. </p>
<p>In order for the individual players to win, they need to beat the dealer&#8217;s five card hand and then the two card hand. Should there be a tie between the player and the dealer, the game for the player ends while the dealer gets the money. The player will only win the money minus a commission for the dealer if he or she beats the dealers or both hands. </p>
<p>Confused yet? Don&#8217;t worry, you will eventually get the hang of the game as long as you start mastering your poker gaming skills â and by practicing the double hand drawing method used in Pai Gow. Â </p>
<p>Developing Pai Gow Strategies to Increase Your Chances of Winning </p>
<p>Just as it is with any other casino game, there are strategies that you can develop in order to increase your chances of winning at Pai Gow. For example, a three pair is a very good hand. It&#8217;s every player&#8217;s rule to always play the highest pair in front, no exceptions. If you have three aces, you can play a pair of aces behind and a high ace in front.Â  If you have a full house, you can play three of a kind behind and use the pair in front. </p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, your traditional poker gaming skills would definitely come in handy if you want to increase your chances of winning at Pai Gow â which is a truly unique and exciting casino card game. </p>

<p>Pai Gow means &#8220;double hand&#8221; poker. In it, a standard 52-card deck with one joker is used.<br /> How it works: The player must create two poker hands out of the seven cards in his hand: a five-card hand and a two-card hand. The five-card hand must outrank the two-card. The two-card hand is the hand &#8220;in front&#8221; and the five-card hand is the hand &#8220;behind.&#8221;<br /> Seven cards are dealt to each player. The only two card hands are pairs or high card. The player then makes his five card hand with the remaining cards.</p>
<p> The five card hands use the standard poker rankings.</p>
<p> How you win: If both of your separated hands beat the banker?s hands, you win. If only one wins, it is a push. If both lose, the player loses. Ties will go to the banker, which gives the house a small advantage. Make sure you understand the rules and do not foul your hand when you split it into two.</p>
<p> Strategy: The first goal is to set the best two-card hand possible within your limits of the game. In other words, the best possible two card hand that still leaves the player with a better five-card hand; your five-card hand must outrank your two-card hand. In general, an average hand will have a pair in the five-card and an ace or king high in the two card hand.</p>
<p> In a Playtech casino, the rules are fixed, but some variations on which hand is best exist in live casinos, so make sure you ask the house rules in these situations. The value of the joker also varies from place to place.</p>
<p> Pai Gow poker was founded in the early 1980s at the Commerce Casino in Los Angeles by the gaming innovator Fred Wolf. The game become popular very quickly, and was soon in Las Vegas and then all over the world. It is an important staple of online gaming now. </p>
<p> The house edge on Pai Gow is not as high because of the length it takes to play, so in general the takeout is higher. But there are many pushes, and it is a game where you can get action for quite some time.</p>
<p> In a playtech casino, the house edge is under 3 percent, roughly 2.85. The house is always the banker in a Playtech casino.</p>
<p> Pai Gow is an interesting twist and combines elements of stud, but it also requires the player to make strategic decisions on how to split the hand. Take some time to play online and get the rules down, and you will find this version of casino poker might be the most interesting to play.</p>

			<a href="http://5star-casinos.com/strategies-for-playing-pai-gow" title="Strategies For Playing Pai Gow"></a><p><strong>Strategies For Playing Pai Gow</strong></p>
<p>For playing the perfect game you have to learn the strategies for playing Pai Gow. Setting both two card and five card hand is the basic strategy. Knowing the game well is another part of the strategies. Playing pre-pay commission games, entering with dragon hands, and making high bids as banker are some of the time tested strategies for good gains.</p>
<p>&#13;If you wish to play the perfect game of Pai Gow with maximum success rate then you will have to take care of well planned strategies for playing Pai Gow. Especially the hand setting strategy is most important for your Pai Gow Games. If you have a good strategy, it will help you in 95% of the situations. There will of course be at least 5% unpredictable situations. Even in those cases your game will be near perfect. Setting the Front 2 and Back 5 referring to the two cards and five card settings in Pai Gow has optimum importance for achieving your desired goal.</p>
<p>&#13;Basically Pai Gow poker game is a variation of ancient Chinese domino game with the identical name. The common name for this version of poker is Pai Gow. A 53 card deck consisting of the 52 traditional cards and one joker is used for the game. The format is one on one. Every player or the players are pitted against the banker. The players compete to form the best possible hand. However, there are a lot of ties and the game progresses at slow pace. Therefore one of the best strategies for the game is to make a modest buy that could last you for quite a long duration.</p>
<p>&#13;In making your strategies you have to conversant with the rules of the game. A wager commences the game. Thereafter every baiter gets seven cards. Either a roll of the dice or computer generated numbers determines who will receive the first card set. The seven cards are split into sets of 2 cards and 5 cards separately called the low and high hand respectively. Ranking goes by poker. However, most of the online casinos treat the sequence of A-2-3-4-5 as the second highest straight captioned the &#8220;Wheel&#8221;. Two card rankings are that a pair will beat a couple of singleton cards. The pairs are ranked according to poker rules with the two Aces topping the list. Similarly the hand with 3-2 is the lowest hand.</p>
<p>&#13;Once the hands are fixed, the banker turns on the game with the &#8220;house way&#8221; rules. Remember if both your hands are inferior to the corresponding hands of the banker than you will lose the entire wager. However, if you win both hands then you earn the wager and 5% commission is taken out of it. But if you pre-pay the commission betting say 5 to win the wager of 0 you will be gainer. It will effectively lower the commission rate from 5% to 4.75%. Another strategic move is to see that your two card hand does not become higher than the five card hand. In such cases your hands will be considered foul and you lose on both counts.</p>
<p>&#13;Making your strategy also requires knowing exactly how to use the joker. It can used to complete a straight, flush or the straight flush. In all other cases it is treated as an Ace. In flush it is treated as the highest unused card. Sometimes the casinos have the dealer deal &#8220;dragon&#8221; hands when there are some empty seats. A player may opt to assume the dragon hand thus playing two positions instead of one.</p>
<p>&#13;However, the most important strategy for improving your chances in the game is your bet as a banker. Higher the bet you make, the greater is the chances of your win. Another important factor is your card arrangement. The house way is the safest of the strategies and requires little improvement.</p>

<p>A combination of ancient Chinese format of Pai Gow and the modern poker games, Pai Gow is exciting and interesting. To succeed you must know how to play Pai Gow. Your job is setting the 7 cards in 5-card high and 2-card low hand and the aim is to beat corresponding hands with the dealer. The sequences are unique as well in Pai Gow.</p>
<p>&#13;Pai Gow offers a very interesting form of the Poker games. However to experience the full excitement and pleasure of the game you should know how to play Pai Gow. The game starts with distribution of 7 cards for each betting area by the dealer irrespective of absence of the player. The seven cards distributed are divided into two parts, one with two cards making the low hand, and the other with five cards making the high hand. One of the players on option, or the dealer by default becomes the bank. If someone opts to become banks he or she must have enough chips to meet all the wagers made. Thereafter the game moves on around the banker&#8217;s hands that form the center point of the game.</p>
<p>&#13;Set principles of the game are that each player at the table is responsible for his or her hand settings. Only the dealer can touch the cards of any of the players and none else. Each of the players is also required to keep all the seven cards in full view of the dealer all the time. After setting their respective high and low hands the players will put them face down on their respective allotted areas in the table. After than he or she will not touch the cards again. The rule is different for the dealer. He or she will set the hands using a set of well defined rules captioned &#8220;the house way&#8221;. You can have a copy of these rules whenever you play Pai Gow teaching you how to play Pai Gow.</p>
<p>&#13;Location of dealing the first card is decided on randomized numbers generated by the computer. When the shaker and dice is used in Pai Gow, it is the dealer cum banker or any other player who is the banker will be counted as 1, 8 or 15. The counting goes counter clockwise starting from the dealer or the banker completing the round up of the whole dice. This marks the beginning of the dealing process. Remember that all the bets have to be made before the dealer announces &#8220;no more bets&#8221; in the game.</p>
<p>&#13;You require quite a good deal of skills to achieve success in the Pai Gow poker. It could be considered as a combination of the old time Chinese Pai Gow and the modern game of Poker. Incidentally, Chinese Pai Gow meant &#8220;makes mine&#8221;. However there is a major difference from the traditional game of poker here. In Pai Gow the player is pitted directly against the dealer. You have to set the seven cards in a specific manner. Your five card hand must show a higher value than your two card hand. At the same time both your high and low hands should have greater values in comparison to the corresponding hands of the dealer.</p>
<p>&#13;53 cards constitute the deck in the game of Pai Gow. This includes the standard 52 cards and a joker. The Joker has multiple uses and can replicate any card excepting as the fourth Ace when you already have three. Advantage of playing in online casino is that you can ask for advices on arranging your hands or you can arrange them all by yourself. While you have the standard poker values for the cards in your hand, the sole aim is to beat both hands held by the dealer. In that case you will get even money minus 5% commission to be taken by the dealer.</p>
<p>&#13;The sequences are a bit unique in the game. A-2-3-4-5 will beat K-Q-J-10-9 but lose to A-K-Q-J-10.</p>

<p>In this modified game of traditional poker, each player and the dealer receive seven cards from which each players must form two hands, one of the five cards and one of two cards. Using the standard poker hand ranking methods (see below), the players must organize their cards so that the five card hand is of higher value than the two card hand. If both hands beat the banker&#8217;s two hands, the player wins. If both hands lose, the player loses. If one hand is higher and the other lower, the hand is a draw or push. Finally, if both hands are exactly equal in value to the banker&#8217;s two hands, the banker wins.</p>
<p> In calculating the hand ranking, the joker is used as an Ace or to complete any straight or any flush. Bets are placed between the banker (which may be the House or another player acting as banker) and the other players. The House charges a 5% commission on all winning wagers. There is no commission charged for tied or losing wagers. If you require assistance, the dealer or supervisor will be happy to assist you in setting the highest possible potential ranking hand according to House Ways. However, we cannot be responsible for any losses that may be incurred. The order of hands from highest to lowest is as follows:</p>
<p> Poker Hand Rankings</p>
<p> 1. 5 Aces (including joker) <br /> 2. Royal Flush <br /> 3. Straight Flush (A,2,3,4,5 highest ranking straight flush) <br /> 4. 4 of a Kind <br /> 5. Full House <br /> 6. Flush <br /> 7. Straight (A2,3,4,5 the 2nd highest straight) <br /> 8. Three Of A Kind <br /> 9. Two Pair <br /> 10. One Pair <br /> 11. High Card </p>

<p>              Game Rules for Pai Gow Poker
<p>This game uses a 53 deck of cards that includes one joker that serves as a wild card. Although the game features a wild card, it should be noted that it may only be used as an ace and also only in order to create certain hands, that is straight, flush or straight flush. In the game of Pai Gow Poker, first of all bets are placed. Then, each player receives seven cards. In the game of online Pai Gow Poker the player plays against the dealer and not against other players. The idea of the game is that players need to create two separate hands of two and five, out of the seven cards dealt. The five card hand must be a stronger hand than the two card hand. The dealer&#8217;s seven cards are then revealed and following this, two hands created accordingly. The player&#8217;s hands are then compared with the corresponding hands of the dealer.</p>

Ways to Win at Pai Gow Poker
<p>In most casinos, Ace, 2, 3, 4 and 5 is considered to be the second highest straight is Pai Gow Poker. In addition, it should be noted that in Pai Gow Poker, the highest possible two card hand consists of two aces. Newcomers to the Pai Gow Poker game first need to learn which situations will provide a win for the player. In the eventuality of the player winning both hands, then the player will be the winner. If the dealer and the player each win one hand then no money is won as this is a tie, known as a &#8216;push&#8217;. If the player wins just one hand, then this also becomes a push. The player&#8217;s wager will be lost in the case where the player&#8217; hands are both inferior to those of the dealer.</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>Bearing in mind, that in order to win the player needs to win both hands, it is therefore necessary to pay close attention to both hands.

			<a href="http://5star-casinos.com/pai-gow-poker" title="Pai Gow Poker"></a><p><strong>Pai Gow Poker</strong></p>
<p>Pai Gow Poker is an American card-playing derivative of the centuries-old game of Chinese Dominoes. In the early nineteenth century, Chinese laborers introduced the game while working in California.</p>
<p>The game&#8217;s popularity with Chinese gamblers eventually attracted the attention of entrepreneurial gamers who substituted the traditional tiles with cards and modeled the game into a new form of poker. Introduced into the poker rooms of California in 1986, the game&#8217;s immediate acceptance and popularity with Asian poker players drew the attention of Nevada&#8217;s casino operators who quickly absorbed the game into their own poker rooms. The popularity of the game has continued into the 21st century.</p>
<p>Pai Gow tables accommodate up to six players and a dealer. Differentiating from traditional poker, all players play against the dealer and not against each other.</p>
<p>In a counterclockwise rotation, each player is dealt seven face down cards by the dealer. Forty-nine cards are dealt, including the dealer&#8217;s seven cards.</p>
<p>Each player and the dealer must form two poker hands: a high hand of five cards and a low hand of two cards. The hands are based on traditional poker rankings and as such, a two card hand of two aces would be the highest possible hand of two cards. A five aces hand would be the highest five card hand. How do you get five aces in a standard fifty-two card deck? You are actually playing with a fifty-three card deck since one joker is allowed into the game. The joker is considered a wild card and can be used as another ace or to complete a straight or flush.</p>
<p>The highest two hands win each game and only a single player having the two highest hands simultaneously can win.</p>
<p>A dice throw from a cup containing three dice determines who will be dealt the first hand. After the hands are dealt, players must form the two poker hands, keeping in mind that the five-card hand must always rank higher than the two-card hand.</p>
<p>When all players have set their hands, the dealer will make comparisons with his or her hand rank for payouts. If a player has one hand higher in rank than the dealer&#8217;s but a lower second hand, this is considered a tie.</p>
<p>If the dealer beats both hands, the player loses. In the case of both player&#8217;s hands and both dealer&#8217;s hands being identical, the dealer wins. In casino play, ofttimes allowances are made for a player to become the dealer. In this case, the player must have the funds for any payoffs due winning players. Of course, the player acting as dealer can corner some large pots if he can beat most of the players.</p>
<p>Some casinos rule that players cannot deal or bank two consecutive hands, and some poker rooms will offer to co-bank 50/50 with any player that elects to take the bank. In all cases, the dealer will ask players in turn if they wish to be the banker.</p>
<p>In Pai Gow Poker, you are dealt &#8220;static&#8221; cards which means you have no opportunity to change cards to possibly improve your hand. However, as in traditional five-card draw, there are strategies to make the best of what you have been dealt. An example is keeping the flushes or straights in the five-card hand and the two cards remaining as the second high hand.</p>
<p>If you are lucky enough to draw four aces and a joker, you can keep three aces in the five-card hand and strengthen your two-card hand with the other ace and joker. Two pair? Keep the higher pair in the five-card hand and the other two matching cards will make up the second hand.</p>

<p>Poker is a wonderful game of skill and strategy and with the advent of online poker the popularity of playing this game has grown exponentially. Because this is a thinking man&#8217;s&#8217; game, many men have thought about it and come up with different ways of playing. </p>
<p>While the basic tenet of poker game remains the same, the game is vastly adaptable to change and this is one of the things which keep playing so interesting. Probably one of the most interesting forms of poker is Pai Gow Poker, and this is played online in many poker rooms as well as in poker rooms at casinos across the world. </p>
<p>Pai Gow Poker is a combination of poker and an ancient Chinese game called Pai Gow which means &#8220;make nine&#8221;; it is played with tiles, like dominos or Mahjong. This game is a cryptic, symbolic game which is not simple to learn.  </p>
<p>Sometime in the 1980&#8242;s Fred Wolf had the bright idea of creating a combination of Poker and Pai Gow, and although its history is not that well documented, since Pai Gow Poker has been available online, the growth on the popularity of playing it has increased immensely. It is an exciting game of double handed poker and it was first showcased in Fred Wolf&#8217;s Commerce Casino in California. It arrived in Las Vegas in 1987, after first being introduced to Atlantic City, so it really is a relatively new form of poker. </p>
<p>The rules of the game are simple to understand and it offers many options for thinking strategy. Pai Gow poker is played with a standard deck of 53 cards, which includes one Joker &#8211; this is the wild card; and each player is dealt 7 cards. These cards have to be split into two hands and the aim of the game is to beat the dealer with standard poker hands. The dealer sets his cards in the &#8220;house way&#8221; which might differ from casino to casino and the game takes longer to play than a normal game of poker, it also has a modest buy-in. This slow pace is what appeals to many players&#8217;, however this factor also makes it a game with a relatively high house edge. </p>
<p>Each player competes to make their best possible hands, and the five card pack is ranked the same as Poker. The two card hand is ranked slightly differently with pair beating singles, and the highest hand being a pair of aces while the lowest is singles of 3-2. Each player&#8217;s hands are compared with the dealers for a win and in the event of a tie the house edge dictates that the dealer wins. </p>
<p>If the player is the winner over the dealer they are paid even money less the house edge which is generally 5% commission. Some games of Pai Gow Poker allow the player to pay the commission up front; for example wagering 5 to win 0. This is actually a good option because believe it or not, it actually lowers the house edge to 4.76%!</p>
