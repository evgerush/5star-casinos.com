<p>There are some games in the online casino where certain players have a distinct advantage over others. One such game is poker. That is why there are different levels of competition in the best online casino poker parlours. Asian players may have an advantage over Europeans and Americans in some of their preferred games, such as Sic Bo and Pai Gow. This advantage is simply the familiarity they have with these games Ã¢Â€Â“ they grew up playing the games and have developed instincts that stand them in good stead when they play them. </p>
<p> There is one game, however, that stands out above all others in its equality of play, and that is the online roulette game. When you play roulette online, the outcome of the game is determined not by one&#8217;s economic status, or wealth, or good looks. The outcome of the online roulette game is determined by a Random Number Generator found in the computer&#8217;s hard drive at the online casino site. </p>
<p> Therefore, when you play roulette online, once the ball begins to spin counterclockwise around the roulette wheel, you have as much chance as anyone else to have the ball drop into the compartment that you have wagered on. To put it succinctly, you have as much opportunity to win when you play roulette online as anybody else. Therefore, it is safe to say that the online roulette game is the fairest game in the online casino parlour. </p>
<p> You can improve your ability to win money on roulette by devising wagering strategies that you are comfortable with. To help you improve your online roulette game, the online casino industry has free casino sites. For example, if you wished to play roulette online at the top-rated free casino site, Onlinegambling.co.uk, you can participate in an online roulette game for as long as you care to play without ever exacting a fee for service or a financial penalty of time overextension. </p>
<p> At Onlinegambling.co.uk and other fine online casino sites, all players are equal under the roulette wheel!</p>

		<div class="post-info"><span class="date time published" title="2010-11-02T04:32:03+0000">November 2, 2010</span>  By <span class="author vcard"><a href="http://5star-casinos.com/author/5 Star Rated Casinos/" title="Posts by 5 Star Rated Casinos" rel="nofollow">5 Star Rated Casinos</a></span> <span class="post-comments"><a href="http://5star-casinos.com/a-look-into-cool#comments" rel="nofollow">Leave a Comment</a></span> </div>		<div class="entry-content">
			<a href="http://5star-casinos.com/a-look-into-cool" title="A Look into Cool"></a><p><strong>A Look into Cool</strong></p>
<p>Lots of people who went thru school as one of the not cool people, spend much of their adult lives trying to become the cool kid they always wanted to be in school, and they go but and buy anything they can that may make people think they are cool, instead of taking a look at what makes some people cool and some people not cool.</p>
<p>Motorcycles and Cars: Many people who are looking to be cool will buy a motorcycle, maybe a Harley Davidson, a big sports bike or a sports car. This is because they feel that a fast car or motorcycle will make people look at them in a positive way, but in reality most people think less of these people.</p>
<p>Clothes, many people like to spend lots of money on the latest fashions to help them improve their image, thinking that people will find them interesting because they know what the hot new things to wear are.</p>
<p>Music: many people will find out what music is being played at the most popular clubs and drive around blasting it from their cars to make people think they are cool because they listen to the same music that is played in all the hot clubs.</p>
<p>Online and Casino Gambling: gambling has become a very popular thing in recent years and with Poker shows popping up on all the TV channels, many people think it is cool to go to the casinos dressed up like famous poker players, including vests with patches from sponsors. As un-cool as dressing like a professional poker player may be playing casino games like Craps, Poker and Blackjack may be cool, games like Sic Bo, Keno and slot machines are not cool unless you hit a Multi Million Dollar jackpot.</p>
<p>Bling: Bling is a term for gold ad silver jewelry, and in recent years the rule has become the cooler you want to appear the large your jewelry must be. For the most part these people are spending lots of money trying to look cool but wind up looking like fools.</p>
<p>Physical Fitness: in recent years many people have decided that if you want to look cool you have to belong to a gym, the people in the gym that are there just to look cool are always easy to spot. They are usually found sitting at the juice bar or in the hot tub. If they do ever actually do any type of workout it is usually ridding a bike for 5 minutes and before they even break a sweat they have to stop.</p>
<p>http://www.fit.moneybizhome.com/</p>
<p>But the truth is that cool is not about what you have and how you look it is about who you are, and if you are choosing your car, your clothes, your music and anything else so that other people will believe you are cool and not because you enjoy these things then as cool as you may think you are, is in direct proportion to how cool you are not.</p>
<p>Being cool is not about wanting to be cool, being cool is about not caring what other people think and living life to its fullest, and in doing this you will find others with the same interests and these people will think of you as cool.</p>
<p>So I guess the key to being cool is just to make friends with people who enjoy the same things you enjoy and in doing so you will find that as your self image increases your need to be cool decreases, and then you will be cool.</p>

			<a href="http://5star-casinos.com/how-casinos-win-your-money" title="How Casinos Win your Money"></a><p><strong>How Casinos Win your Money</strong></p>
<p>Most casino games are games of chance where the draw results are simply a probability value among all the possibility. Theoretically, the casino and the players should have the equal chances of winning; but, are you aware that casinos are making most of money from their players and majority of gamblers are losers? What actually make casinos the long term winners and consistently earn the money from their players? The 3 key casino&#8217;s winning factors are: house edge, maximum limit and psychology factor.</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>The House Edge</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>The key factor that helps casinos make a lot of money is the mathematical formula behind it. The mathematical advantage of casino enjoys over the players is known as &#8220;the house edge&#8221;. With the house edge advantage, the casinos are able to calculate their expected revenues, the money that the casinos will surely win from their players in long run. The higher the house edge value in any casino games, the more money will go to the casino. For example, the Sic Bo Big / Small have house edge of 2.78% which means in the long run, the casino will win the 2.78% of the money bet on the Big/Small in Sic Bo game. If you play at game with house edge of 5% versus 2.5%, meaning that you will lose twice as fast as in the second game.</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>The Maximum Limit</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>In any casino games, it is very common to have runs of 5, 6 or even 10 consecutive outcomes of black or red, high or low, even or uneven; but it does not happen in any casino in the earth to have 50 consecutive equal outcomes. If you bet on red in roulette and the outcomes are black in the consecutive runs, it will turn into red finally. This mean that if you have sufficient fund to double up your betting using the technique called Martingale, you will finally win back all the money you lose plus one chip. Now you see why casinos want to set a maximum limit in all games. This is to ensure the Martingale techniques does not work even you have sufficient fund to double your betting after every loss. If you apply the Martingale technique, you will finally hit the maximum limit of the table and it stops you from double up your betting. The maximum limit is the winning strategy for casinos.</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>Psychology Factors</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>Do you notice that players who win money want to win more? That&#8217;s why they do not want to leave the table until they lose all their money. Do you also notice that the players who lose money want to win back their money in the shortest time, if possible within a few draws? That&#8217;s why they are increasing their betting size every time they loss until that lose all their money.</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>Although all gamblers try to become the smart players, they have their own betting strategies trying to win as much money as possible from the casino. In fact, no one want to lose money to the casino, instead, most of the players want to get rich by winning the money from casino.</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>In actually fact, their betting strategies may get them win initially, but they become greedy and forget about all their betting strategies that may required them to leave the table after specific number of runs; what they do is continue bets without following their strategies anymore. They will regret about their greedy behavior after they lose all their money. This is the psychology factor that makes the casinos the winners in long runs.</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>Summary</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>Casinos are the winners in the long run as they enjoy advantages in term of house edge and maximum limit set for each game. In addition, the psychology behaviors of the casino&#8217;s players have put advantage to the casino to win the money from their players.</p>

<p><strong>Typically, when a person is taking a look at the history and reputations of online casinos, they right away are able to place casinos into the trustworthy and untrustworthy categories, but we might forgive a person if they are not able to do this with the Real Time Gaming casino. This is because of the fact that RTG was a terrible casino when it opened up and through incompetence and a lack of understanding ended up marring their name. They have recently really gotten it together however and in spite of their previous reputation, they have a lot going for them at the present moment in time. </strong> </p>
<p>&#13;<br />
Click here to visit The Best Online Casino<br />&#13;<br />
Games
<p>The gaming selection that you will find at the Real Time Gaming Online Casino is some of the best gaming selection that is available out there. What makes it good on a totally basic basis is the fact that choice is available in abundance. For people that are regular casino goers and just want the basics, there are a number of slot machines and video poker machines to choose from. Fans of table games will also have blackjack, craps, roulette, baccarat and other similar games to choose from too. However, even for people that enjoy the more exotic casino games, there is a lot of choice available. Specifically, taking a look at games like Casino War, Let It Ride, Sic Bo, Keno and a number of others shows the sheer amount of choice and selection that is available at Real Time Gaming.</p>
<p>&#13;<br />
Speed
<p>One of the reasons that people calling themselves action junkies would love the online casino way of playing in general is that it is a lot faster than the alternatives. It is a lot faster in the sense that you are going to be able to do more over the same amount of time, ergo the element of faster speed that many people associate with online casinos. Just as you can play more hands of poker online, you can play more blackjack hands online as well. Sometimes, this will even resolve itself into up to ten hands a minute and that is something that is extremely quick!</p>
<p>&#13;<br />
Leverage
<p>An interesting thing about action junkies is the fact that they tend to get used to increasing levels of action very quickly and then tend to go around looking for more. Well, if this sounds like you, then the one thing that you can have fun with is the fact that RTG software allows you to leverage your gaming experience by creating multiple tables and playing them all at once. This means that you can play Blackjack, Baccarat, Sic Bo and others all at the same time from the same piece of software and when you combine that with the increased level of play inherent to online casinos, you already have a situation that most action junkies would absolutely adore.</p>
