			<a href="http://5star-casinos.com/how-to-play-online-blackjack" title="How To Play Online Blackjack"></a><p><strong>How To Play Online Blackjack</strong></p>
<p>Blackjack is simple to understand and not too difficult to master. You can earn a fortune while playing blackjack. Thousands of <strong>online blackjack</strong> players has done that and you too can do it. Read on to clear any doubts that you have about blackjack.</p>
<p> Objective of the Game
<p>The objective of the game is to beat the dealer by making a hand valued at 21 or closest to it. Anything more than 21 is considered a &#8220;bust&#8221; or &#8220;too many&#8221;, which leads to immediate defeat.</p>
<p> Card Rankings
<p>In blackjack, cards from 2 to 10 carry their face value. Jack, Queen, and King are valued at 10. The Ace is valued at 1 or 11, depending upon your choice. When you play online blackjack, any Ace dealt is automatically counted as 1 or 11, so you don&#8217;t need to know how an Ace is counted.</p>
<p> Beginning a Game
<p>To begin a game, you need to place your bet within the table limits. This bet is also called &#8220;ante&#8221;. After you place your bet, you and the dealer are dealt two cards each. Both of your cards are visible whereas only one of the dealer&#8217;s cards is visible. This card is called &#8220;up card&#8221; and the card that lies faced down is called &#8220;hole card&#8221;.</p>
<p> Your Turn
<p>If you are not dealt a blackjack (a combination of Ace and any 10 value card), count your hand total. Your goal is to build a potentially winning hand, so judging the quality of your hand, you can take further actions listed below.</p>
<p> <strong>Hit :</strong> Drawing another card is called a hit. You don&#8217;t need to place additional bets to hit. After a hit, your hand total is increased by the value of the drawn card. <strong>Double :</strong> You can even double down your bet, if you see a potentially winning hand. For example, if your hand total is 10 or 11, the highest card that you can be dealt is a 10 value card. If it happens, your hand total can shoot to 20 or 21, respectively, which isn&#8217;t a bad hand, is it? Please note that you are dealt a card automatically when you double down your bet. <strong>Split :</strong> Sometimes you are dealt two identical cards, called a pair. If you wish to play two separate hands rather than playing one hand, you can split the pair. Splitting requires you to place an additional bet equal to your initial bet. In online <strong>blackjack games</strong>, this bet is placed automatically when you choose to split.
<p><strong>Stand :</strong> If you are satisfied with your hand total, you can choose to stand and pass the turn over to the dealer.</p>
<p> Dealer&#8217;s Turn
<p>When you stand, the dealer takes over. The dealer takes further actions according to a different set of rules. Under the most common rules, the dealer must hit on a hand total of 16 or less. And must stand on 17 or more. Casinos may customize these rules so don&#8217;t forget to check out the rules in advance. We at Club Player Casino follow the most common set of rules.</p>
<p> Determining the Outcome of a Game
<p>To determine the outcome of a game, your hand is compared against the dealer&#8217;s. If your hand is better than the dealer, you win the game and receive an even payout. But if it&#8217;s the other way around, you lose your bet immediately. In case of a tie, your bet is returned to you.</p>
<p>Once a game is over, you can start a new game by placing another bet and getting the cards dealt.</p>
<p> Insurance Bet
<p>In Blackjack Games, you can place a side bet called insurance bet when the dealer shows an Ace. You are paid 2-to-1 on insurance bet and this bet is equal to half your initial bet. You bet on dealer&#8217;s blackjack. If the dealer comes up with a blackjack, you get the payout. However, if the dealer does not come up with a blackjack, you lose your insurance bet. In any case, the game still continues and your hand is compared against the dealer&#8217;s to determine the outcome.</p>
<p>To begin playing blackjack, that&#8217;s all you need to know. To sharpen your blackjack skills, you can read about advanced blackjack techniques like basic blackjack strategy and blackjack card counting. These techniques can certainly help you make good in <strong>online blackjack</strong> as well as in land-based blackjack.</p>

<p>Online casinos have been able to attract more number of Blackjack players than those playing at the traditional casinos. Apart from earning prize money through Blackjack gaming, players are also attracted towards the bonuses offered by the online casino. Sign up bonuses, referral bonuses and good performance bonuses are some of the many ways adopted by the online casinos to value their Blackjack players.

			<a href="http://5star-casinos.com/blackjack-sniper" title="Blackjack Sniper"></a><p><strong>Blackjack Sniper</strong></p>
<p>Blackjack Sniper &#8211; Dominate the Blackjack Tables</p>
<p>My Friend<br />If your dream is to have multiple streams of automated<br />income over the Internet, then this course can show<br />you how to ACTUALLY make that happen (unlike most<br />courses, which make empty promises that they can&#8217;t<br />deliver on).  </p>
<p>If you have been an online gambler for any length of time, you probably have heard of a product called Roulette Sniper.  This product has been on the market for quite some time, and has become legendary in some circles because of its flexibility, ease of use, and accuracy to help the online roulette player defeat the wheel.  This software is used in conjunction with the online casinos.</p>
<p>Recently, there has been a new Sniper product released.  This product is called Blackjack Sniper.  The Blackjack Sniper software incorporates many different strategies that help the player to win at online blackjack.</p>
<p>Much like Roulette Sniper, Blackjack Sniper lets you download a complimentary free trial so that you can evaluate the software before you decide to buy.  This helps remove any doubt from your mind that this product may or may not be for you.  You will find that most other blackjack products online do not offer this sort of trial, which begs the question: Do these other blackjack strategies work, or are they just trying to grab your money up front in hopes that you don&#8217;t ask for a refund later on.  To put any doubts in your mind to rest, I strongly recommend you download the free trial of Blackjack Sniper so you can see for yourself if it is for you.</p>
<p>The strategies that Blackjack Sniper uses are a combination of blackjack strategy, card counting, wager adjustment, timed events, and progression.  All of these options can be toggled on or off for your convenience, and to suite your play style.</p>
<p>If you think that Blackjack Sniper is just a basic blackjack calculator, then you are very wrong.  First, I have downloaded a few of these &#8220;free&#8221; calculators, and to my beloved surprise, my virus alarm rang with Trojans that I couldn&#8217;t get off my PC. In fact, I had to reinstall my operating system and all my favorite software back on to my computer, all thanks to this &#8220;free&#8221; junk.</p>
<p>Second, these &#8220;free&#8221; calculators offer no advanced strategy, besides a basic strategy card in software format. They have no card counting, no timed events, and new wagering.  Usually, free means junk.</p>
<p>Third, these &#8220;free&#8221; calculators are just a means to direct traffic to casinos.  The author of the Blackjack Sniper software has tested the software at the recommended online casinos, and knows them to be reputable so that when you win, you get paid your winnings.</p>
<p>Some might say that card counting in the online casino world makes no sense, and most people would be correct about that assumption, but there are many online casinos that offer live dealer play.  In this instance, you will find that you can use the card counting successfully.  Also, with the adjust wager option, if you have done your homework on how card counting works, Blackjack Sniper will automatically adjust your wager according to the card count.</p>
<p>Bonus money is another topic that people have an issue with.  Like most table games, blackjack is restricted so that you can&#8217;t actually claim the bonus.  I have found one casino that actually lets you claim the entire bonus, and this is at the Bet 365 casino, a Playtech casino (very reputable).  You can find your way to this casino from the Blackjack Sniper website.  They have a no download flash version of blackjack that is really easy to win at, plus you will be able to claim your entire bonus money.  Remember to play &#8220;Classic Blackjack&#8221;, as all other forms of blackjack at this casino have bonus restrictions.</p>
<p>Hopefully this review helps you make a wise and informed decision without jumping to any conclusions.  Blackjack is fun, and in fact, almost as fun as roulette.  If you have any doubts that Playtech software is rigged, then you need to check the rogue forums, such as casinomeister.  Enjoy your winning with Blackjack Sniper, and we will see you at the tables.    </p>
<p>I thank you for taking the time to read this short report and I sincerely hope you take action<br />and make your life happier and wealthier for the better.</p>

			<a href="http://5star-casinos.com/ken-uston-%e2%80%93-the-hero-of-blackjack-card-game" title="Ken Uston – The Hero of Blackjack Card Game"></a><p><strong>Ken Uston – The Hero of Blackjack Card Game</strong></p>
<p>In 2003 Ken Uston was honored to become one of 7 initial nominees of The Blackjack Hall of Fame for his input in the development of this popular card game. Being the author of many blackjack books and the player who considered blackjack to be not only his job but the whole life, Ken Uston was able to impact the game itself: he managed his blackjack team using a strategy of team play for winning; thanks to this person, players have a right to use card counting today without a fear to be caught for blackjack cheating.</p>
<p>Ken Uston started his career at blackjack being a member of one blackjack team managed by one more significant blackjack figure â Al Francesco. Mr. Uston had been playing blackjack with this team for 3 years and won much money for it. But soon he decided that it was not enough for him and formed his own blackjack team in 1976; moreover, he wrote his first book at that time which had changed his relations with Al Francesco forever.</p>
<p>The Big Player was published in 1977; Ken Uston told there everything connected with his work in Al Francesco&#8217;s team, including schemes and secrets of blackjack team play. This book became fatal for Al Francesco and his team because they were banned from casinos forever.</p>
<p>After this case Ken Uston continued writing books on the topic of blackjack and devoted all his time to this card game. He played in different casinos and won big sums of money though casinos did not stay indifferent to such easy winnings of course: Ken Uston was often banned from different casinos though, anyway, found a way how to continue playing blackjack. He is known also as a master of disguise because he often wore costumes to change appearance and not to be recognized by pit bosses.</p>
<p>Ken Uston is also known as a person who won the case against Atlantic City casinos: he proved the fact blackjack players had a right to use the method of card counting for playing blackjack, and this method should not be considered as blackjack cheating.</p>
<p>Mr. Uston devoted all his life to the game of blackjack and died in the age of 52 because of heart attack in 1987: he had been found dead in his apartment in Paris. So, it is clear that Ken Uston had become a nominee of The Blackjack Hall of Fame posthumously, and was called to be one of 7 blackjack idols â the main figures in the history of blackjack card game. Moreover, the film had been created about the personality of Ken Uston, and it was called to be The Blackjack Man (2005).</p>

<p> The rules of this game is almost same, whether you are playing online or at the casino center.There are standard card values involved The bet amount is based upon before you hit. You could even make use of the additional cards, if you need from the dealer The main thing here is that you have to get the value which is close to the twenty one.Now  after the hit, if the value goes beyond twenty one, the player will lose all the money to the dealer.When it comes to the online mode of playing similarly, one has to click the hit button to request for more cards. If you win the game, then you would get the amount based on the bet value that have decided upon.</p>
<p> There are many reputed and most popular casino centers are available, where you could play BlackJack for real cash.There are different variants of the BlackJack game such as Regular Blackjack, Spanish 21, Double Exposure Blackjack, Single deck Blackjack and blackjack switch.Though the game itself is based on probability, there are certain other factors which determine the win.Some of these factors are bankroll management, betting strategy, table selection etc.</p>
<p> You would get four standard choices, if you have two initial cards. These are Split-a –pair, Double Down, Stand, hit.

		<div class="post-info"><span class="date time published" title="2010-11-03T13:32:02+0000">November 3, 2010</span>  By <span class="author vcard"><a href="http://5star-casinos.com/author/5 Star Rated Casinos/" title="Posts by 5 Star Rated Casinos" rel="nofollow">5 Star Rated Casinos</a></span> <span class="post-comments"><a href="http://5star-casinos.com/a-quick-rundown-on-the-people-in-the-blackjack-hall-of-fame#comments" rel="nofollow">Leave a Comment</a></span> </div>		<div class="entry-content">
			<a href="http://5star-casinos.com/a-quick-rundown-on-the-people-in-the-blackjack-hall-of-fame" title="A Quick Rundown on the People in the Blackjack Hall of Fame"></a><p><strong>A Quick Rundown on the People in the Blackjack Hall of Fame</strong></p>
<p>From it&#8217;s inception in 2003, the Blackjack Hall of Fame has inducted a total of 11 members for their outstanding accomplishments, both at the tables and away from them.</p>
<p>&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<p>Edward O. Thorp, one of the original Blackjack Hall of Fame members, was a mathematician and scholar, known as the Father of Card Counting by professional players and the general populous alike.  His Ten Count system was first introduced to the world in his 1962 book, &#8220;Beat the Dealer&#8221;, which was the very first winning blackjack system ever published, not to mention that it was also the first mathematician publication to beat any casino-style gambling game. Every card counting system available today is a derivative of Thorp&#8217;s Ten Count system.</p>
<p>&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<p>Ken Uston, an original inductee, passed away in 1987, years before the Blackjack Hall of Fame was even a thought.  Uston brought the secrets of the big card counting teams mainstream with his book, &#8220;The Big Player&#8221;, creating a commotion throughout the gaming industry.  After his landmark publication, card counting teams began to generate across the globe.</p>
<p>&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<p>The inventor of blackjacks&#8217; &#8220;team play&#8221; is one of the original members of the Hall of Fame- Al Francesca. Francesca was the driving force and mastermind behind Ken Uston and his book, &#8220;The Big Player&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<p>Blackjack researchers have been using the mathematical methods of Peter Griffin, as he was the first to break down any card counting system into two points-the Betting Correlation (BC) and the Playing Efficiency (PE). His book, &#8220;The Theory of Blackjack&#8221;, along with his many other mathematical papers made him an easy pick for the original Blackjack Hall of Fame lineup.</p>
<p>&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<p>Stanford Wong, often referred to as the &#8220;Godfather of Blackjack&#8221;, was an original inductee into the Hall of Fame. The term &#8220;wonging&#8221; is related to his proven techniques of card counting across the globe. Wong was one of the first to beat the continuous shuffle machines of Las Vegas before they were removed and updated.</p>
<p>&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<p>Yet another original member of the Blackjack Hall of Fame, Arnold Snyder, was inducted for first to publish what is now common knowledge amongst professional blackjack players; the importance of penetration.  Although he has written many publications on the topic of blackjack, Snyder refrains from publishing much of what he has learned to allow current players the opportunities to play and win.</p>
<p>&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<p>While still in college, Tommy Hyland began playing professional blackjack, and has been for over 25 years.  He is the leading man in the longest running and most successful blackjack team in the entire world. Adored by his peers and despised by casino owners, Tommy has made his mark in the blackjack world and is an original inductee into the Hall of Fame. </p>
<p>&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<p>2004 and the Blackjack Ball brought Keith Taft to the Hall of Fame, complete with a photo album featuring a variety of gadgets and such that he invented to aid in the casino beating process, with his primary focus always on blackjack. Taft credits his son, Marty, for the two were an unbeatable team since Marty was a teenager.</p>
<p>&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<p>Max Rubin is the author of &#8220;Comp City&#8221;, a publication aimed at beating the Blackjack tables of Las Vegas even without mastering the art of counting cards. Rubin is the other Hall of Fame&#8217;s inductee for 2004.</p>
<p>&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<p>The 2005 Blackjack Ball brought with it two new inductees into the Blackjack Hall of Fame, one being Julian Brown, an IBM computer programmer became captivated with the mathematics involved in blackjack. In the 1960&#8242;s Brown wrote to Edward O. Thorp and requested a copy of the blackjack computer program.  Since Brown had access to some of the fastest computers available, he worked diligently to produce an improved program, resulting in the creation of Hi-Opt blackjack and Hi-Lo strategies.  Most of today&#8217;s blackjack experts have built upon the work of Julian Brown.</p>
<p>&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<p>2005&#8242;s second inductee is none other that Lawrence Revere, a card shark and hustler who created a series of amazingly simple, color coded charts and such so that anyone could understand.  Revere is considered to be the man who brought blackjack to the average player.</p>
<p>&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<p>The professional hole-carder&#8217;s bible, &#8220;Beyond Counting&#8221;, was authored by none other than James Grosjean, thus sealing his fate as the 2006 Blackjack Hall of Fame inductee.  Although every tactic used by Grosjean was legal at the time, he was ridiculed and arrested for his practices.  In turn, he sued Caesars and Imperial Palace for wrongful arrest, as well as the Griffin Detective Agency, forcing them into bankruptcy, paving the way to stop libeling professional gamblers.</p>

<p>One of the best ways of foreseeing the future is to understand the human nature. Our needs, hopes, problems and dreams are often the basis for our future making. The nature of the human being is one of the most important ingredients in a complicated gambling business. Each of the parties &#8211; a casino and a gambler, long to win money from each other. And the growing strain will determine the future of the game.</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>Blackjack before 1962:</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>Before publication of the classic book “Beat The Dealer” by Edward O. Thorp in 1962 no single player had ever suspected of such a thing as the Basic Strategy. Everyone used one&#8217;s own mixture of superstitions concerning the way in which one or the other hand had to play. Plus, some experience gained while playing at home in the kitchen. Excluding a small number of professional card-players who intuitively presupposed that their overbalance would be more if there were more bowers left in a pack, practically none won in blackjack. Naturally, casinos felt quite comfortable under such conditions. Till 1962 blackjack was not very popular, though percentagewise the profit rate was exclusively high.</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>The next decade: from 1962 till 1972:</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>After publication of the book by Thorp the situation changed radically. When the book mounted the peak of sales, became a bestseller, and the professor Thorp became an internationally famous personality, casinos were terrified that thus everyone could learn the system of Thorp and would start beating casinos winning huge amounts of money.</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>The results of this panic are well-known. The majority of casinos cardinally changed the blackjack rules creating even a larger overbalance in comparison with the previous set of rules. These introductions were effective a few weeks only as the majority of casinos’ clients simply refused to play a game with such bad rules. Subordinating to the law of supply and demand casinos had to quickly restore traditional rules for all. After this gamblers started immediately to play again, more than that in considerably larger quantities. </p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>The popularity of Thorp’s book played into the hands of casinos. Blackjack started to attract crowds of people who thought they could “beat a dealer” only after they had read one book. </p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>But the fact remained that casinos’ visitors continued to lose the same amounts of money while playing blackjack as before. Only the number of gamblers increased a hundred times. The majority of those who had read the book simply didn’t understand the way the calculation of tens given in the book worked, and those who got to the bottom didn’t take enough pains so as to master the system of calculation from A to Z. Casinos observed in surprise the incredibly increased profits. </p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>Reedition of the book in 1966 gave a reader a simpler calculation system. Over that period of time a number of books on blackjack were published. The game gathered pace. Casinos were setting more and more tables. Blackjack was becoming the most popular game in casinos having outrun the previous leader craps. </p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>Blackjack of the 70s:</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>The classic book “Playing Blackjack as a Business” by Lawrence Revere is responsible for further increase in popularity of the game in the 70s to a great extent. Revere published a shortened version of his systems at the beginning of 1969, but by 1972 already thousands of copies of the book were sold out. Revere republished an extended version of the book offering his simple and effective systems of the game which increased blackjack popularity even more.</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>Also the book “Winning Blackjack” by Stanley Roberts, was in the right place at the right time, in addition the author appeared in a number of radio and TV-shows. Roberts invested a considerable amount of money into advertising of his book making a splash.</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>Casinos were once again overcome by the fit of paranoia. They started to suspect that the systems developed with the help of research methods could considerably influence their profits. Casinos started to introduce a multi-pack blackjack instead of a one-pack blackjack to struggle against the system game. </p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>At the beginning of the 70s a lot of scientists, mathematicians, university professors and other “intellectuals” started to write books about blackjack. Some of them developed their own cards’ calculation systems. One of the most popular and effective systems &#8211; Hi-Opt I, was developed in 1974 with the help of computer programs created by Julian Brown with participation of an anonymous postgraduate of a large Canadian university.</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>A lot of professional gamblers transferred from the Revere system to the Hi-Opt I system because of the relative simplicity and effectiveness of the latter one. A lot of ordinary gamblers started to use the system together with the basic strategy. These two systems evidently made the biggest impact upon casinos’ profits because of their use by professionals. Roberts&#8217; systems were more often used by amateurs.</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>Kenneth Uston, teams and Great Horror:</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>Kenneth Uston noticed sometime at the end of 1976 that he was amazed by the way how effective the simplest systems of Hi-Opt I type could be. In Uston’s book “Big Player“the way how Uston and his companions won together more than a million of dollars playing blackjack is described. Later on his teams transferred from very complicated systems to the simplest of Hi-Opt I type. Uston was thrown out of a few big casinos of Las Vegas, and he filed lawsuit against them for a total amount of 80 million dollars.</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>With the arrival of Uston the whole new era of blackjack began. Casinos were once again frightened that teams could win huge amounts of money in blackjack. Nearly at once some casinos did away with a one- and two-pack blackjack transferring to 4-, 6- and 8-pack ones. For an average gambler blackjack became too difficult. Plus, casinos started to cut most cards out of play &#8211; to two packs. As has been mentioned by Roberts in one of his articles, such practice was at the very least doubtful. By the way, the fact itself of availability of cards which didn’t enter the game caused new kinds of crooked gambling connected with withdrawal and addition of cards. </p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>Casinos up to now change the number of packs and the extent of cutting, and compare levels of profits, thus balancing rules. In any case, rules are extremely difficult for gamblers in the USA, especially beginners.</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>The nightmare continues:</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>The funniest thing is that gamblers&#8217; thoughts are not rigid. Uston’s teams were followed by Keith Taft with his pocket computer for blackjack which played better than any profs in the world. The court of Nevada State broke the record of the USA on the quickness of adoption of statute on use of computers in casinos. Up to five years with confiscation in the current situation, though Taft and his advocates were sure of the unconstitutionality of that law.</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>Forbade the computer? There appeared Tommy Hyland and his most complicated systems of tracking. A new headache for casinos… To worsen the cutting, introduce more packs and make the procedure of riffle even longer. To invent shuffle-machines!</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>Stanford Wong was the first to outwit these shuffle-machines. The most important thing was to know how they worked. Poor casinos didn’t know what to do. These machines cost rather a lot.</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>Perhaps new varieties would help? Spanish 21, Super-fan 21, 6:5 blackjack, “Open” blackjack, Blackjack-switch, Pontoon… With every introduction there was one problem: either no one played it at all or profs immediately found the way to beat it. Tournaments? Old Wong created teams especially for tournament struggle. Every new rule was calculated and intensively looked into a week in advance. The development of the Internet caused quick information distribution.</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>Further on the whole pleiad of gamblers of the contemporary generation came on stage. Wong, Sneider, Anderson, Dogerty, Shlesinger and heaps of people who were occupied with theory and practical aspects of the game. Mathematical models of the game were worked out. Texts on Blackjack were published in scientific reviews.</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>Finally, up to the present moment a small number of professionals still win in blackjack. And will win in the future. Some profs transfer to more complicated systems which are plentiful (let’s say, Hi-Opt II was published as far back as 1976). New methods and techniques are being developed.</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>There is no doubt that it will get still more and more difficult to win in blackjack. However, there difficulties only make gambling wits work harder and harder. Right away new game systems are being worked out in many heads and at many computers of the world.</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>It is important to understand that gamblers always have a hope. They can change games. They can finally read a textbook on the theory of probability. They can read the same books themselves. They can spend even more money on the newest technologies. However, I assure You, there will always be a way to beat them.</p>

<p>Blackjack is one of the most popular card games in gambling history. Now you don’t have to go all the way to Las Vegas to play blackjack for fun or real money, because many Internet casinos offer online blackjack. The advantages of playing blackjack online are numerous, and some gamblers enjoy online play even more than live casino play. Here are just some of the advantages of playing blackjack online.</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>One of the advantages of playing blackjack online is the convenience. You can play online blackjack 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, because that’s when online casinos are open. Whenever you’re ready to play online blackjack, there will be a game waiting for you. You don’t have to leave your house and stand around in a smoky casino waiting for a table to open up. Online blackjack is available right from your home computer, and you will never have to wait for a seat.</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>Choice of play is another one of the advantages of playing blackjack online. One of the great things about the game of blackjack is that it relies far more on skill than luck. Many reputable Internet casinos will let you play online blackjack for free as often as you like, so you can get plenty of practice in and sharpen your blackjack skills before you start playing for money. You can also play any of the different variations of blackjack when you play at an Internet casino, and shop around for the rules that are the most favorable, such as blackjack tables where the dealer does not have the soft 17 rule, or where the DOA (Double On All) and DAS (Double After Split) rules are in effect. These are just a few of the advantages of playing blackjack online!</p>

<p>To win blackjack consistently you need more than the understanding of blackjack rules, you need a black strategy that will show you how to completely dominate the house on a regular basis. Without the proper blackjack strategies in place you will be setting yourself up for a disaster. In order to consistently beat casino after casino, you need to have a blackjack cheat sheet. A blackjack sheet will show you win to HIT, STAND, DOUBLE DOWN, etc&#8230; based on what the dealer is showing and the value in your hand. If you don&#8217;t know the black jack rules, they are very simple. The basic blackjack strategy and rules to follow is getting yourself as close as you can to 21 without busting or going over and beating the dealer&#8217;s hand. The dealer has a natural advantage over other players at the blackjack table because they get to see if you as a player BUSTS or not. If you bust the house automatically wins and you lose. It&#8217;s the worst feeling in the world busting and allowing the dealer to win the hand without them having to take another card!</p>
<p>&#13;If you follow a great blackjack system, there should be no reason why you are busting that often. There is a blackjack cheat sheet in place for these types of situations where it could go as a hold, stand, or hit. If you follow these simple black jack rules you should have no reason making a stable income playing blackjack online or in person. Before you nose dive into playing online blackjack or live casino blackjack, you need to play free blackjack. You can find blackjack for free just about everywhere you turn on the internet. A simple google search will find you plenty of free casino sites to play blackjack on. The great thing about blackjack is that you can gain experience over the house playing for FREE. This is the only type of gambling game that lets you gain as much experience as you need completely free. Once you find a blackjack system that works for you than at that point in time you can move into playing blackjack online or in person for real money. Blackjack is the only gambling game where you can gain as much experience as you want completely free, unlike online poker where you HAVE to play for real money to gain experience. You can&#8217;t play online poker for free because the poker players at play money games will go all in with any hand that they see. With blackjack you are playing against the house as you would for real money. There is no difference in the type of game or competition based on money. Consistently earning a stable income playing blackjack online is one of the best feelings in the world. I have quit my day job and only play blackjack online to earn a stable income. Recently I just broke the 100k a year mark and you can too!</p>
